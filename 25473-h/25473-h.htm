<h2>THE FRONTIER BOYS</h2>

<h3>By CAPT. WYN ROOSEVELT</h3>


<p>This series tells the adventures of Jim, Joe, and
Tom Darlington, first in their camp wagon as they
follow the trail to the great West in the early days.
They are real American boys, resourceful, humorous,
and&mdash;but you must meet them. You will find them
interesting company. They meet with thrilling adventures
and encounters, and stirring incidents are
the rule, not exception.</p>

<p>Historically, these books present a true picture of
a period in our history as important as it was picturesque,
when the nation set its face toward this vast
unknown West, and conquered it.</p>

<h2>FRONTIER BOYS ON THE<br />
COAST</h2>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>CAPTAIN BILL BROOM</h3>


<p>"What devilment has old Bill got on for tonight,
Pete?"</p>

<p>The speaker was seated on an old scarred sea
chest in a dimly lighted forecastle.</p>

<p>"I dunno," replied Pete, "maybe he's lookin' fer a
wreck."</p>

<p>"I <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'hearn'">heard</ins> the mate say somethin' about a passel of
four boys," put in a third man who was laying back
in his bunk, "that the skipper was a-lookin' for."</p>

<p>"Kidnapping, eh?" said Cales, the first speaker.
"Hold 'em for ransom, I suppose. Well, the old
man has been in worse games than that. I reckon
the kids' parents are rich and are willin' to pay a
high price for their darlings."</p>

<p>"You're on the wrong tack, matey," said the man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
in the bunk. "Cap'n Brinks, who landed in San
Diego from a Mexican port put the old man wise.
He told him that those fellars had considerable
money and a raft of jewels with 'em that they
picked up in Mexico."</p>

<p>"Ho, Ho, that's the game, is it," cried Cales,
thumping his knee with a gnarled fist, "that ought to
be easy then."</p>

<p>"Looks so, but it ain't," replied the other, "those
four boys have got somethin' of a reputation in the
southwest. Hard fighters and good shots and their
leader is a husky lad and about as crafty as a red
Injun."</p>

<p>"He ain't met the Old Man yet," said Cales significantly.</p>

<p>"I don't see where you get all your news from,
Jake," growled Pete from his seat on the chest,
"you ought to be a reporter."</p>

<p>"I keep my eyes open and my mouth shet," replied
Jake, "any man can get larned if he will do
that."</p>

<p>"I'd like to have a picter of you with your mouth
shet," remarked Pete. "It's open even when you
are asleep." He dodged just in time to avoid a
heavy shoe flung from Jake's ready hand that
crashed against the wall.</p>

<p>"Don't do that agin," he warned, a red light<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
showing in his eyes. "I'll larn you boys that I
ain't as old as I looks to be."</p>

<p>Jake laughed harshly.</p>

<p>"You mustn't keep your own mouth open so wide,
Pop, cause you'll have to swallow your own words
if you do."</p>

<p>"I guess I'll never git choked," replied Pete,
truculently. "Kin you tell me what the skipper
means snooping down this coast with no lights
showing when it's plumb dark? We are liable to
sink ourselves or Californey all of a suddint."</p>

<p>"Why don't you ask the Cap'n what he is up to?"
inquired Cales, "that is, if you want some real useful
information, Pop."</p>

<p>Pop raised himself up and glared at the speaker.</p>

<p>"I ain't done living," he replied.</p>

<p>"We are navigating pretty careful," remarked
Jake. "You can hardly feel the Sea Eagle moving."</p>

<p>"Running for the cove, I reckon," suggested
Cales, "I'm mighty pleased not to be the man at the
wheel. Well, I'm goin' to turn in for a snooze."</p>

<p>In a brief time the two men were snoring loudly,
while old Pete sat smoking his pipe, as stolid as a
wooden Indian and the forecastle was fogged with
the smoke, through which the swinging lantern
shone dimly. The air is stifling so let us go up on
deck where we can breathe the salt ozone and inci<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>dentally
get acquainted with Captain Bill Broom,
who is to occupy such a prominent place in this
narrative.</p>

<p>He is well worth meeting, not only as the opponent
of our old friend, Jim Darlington, but because of
his own unworthy but interesting character. In
those days Skipper Bill Broom was known all up
and down the coast and beyond. His fame, such
as it was, comes down even to this recent day.</p>

<p>On deck it is muffling dark, with the stars
obscured in some dim way by mist or fog. There
is a breeze blowing steadily from the broad wastes
of the ocean. The bulk of the California coast
looms dimly on the port bow. Not more than a
half mile distant can be seen the white rushing
forward of the breakers towards the rocky coast.</p>

<p>Dangerous work this, navigating the Sea Eagle
through the thick gloom of the night but the old
man knew his business. He was on the bridge
pacing back and forth like some strange animal and
giving hoarse directions to the man at the wheel.
He knew every inch of that coast, the sunken reefs
and dangerous rocks.</p>

<p>"Starboard your helm," he growled.</p>

<p>The sailor spun the wheel obediently. And the
captain resumed his pacing back and forth upon the
bridge. Not much could be seen of him, except<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
that he was a powerful man, with a peculiar crouching
stoop, as if he and the sea were engaged in a
mysterious game. One striving to get a dangerous
death-hold upon the other, both wary and using
unceasing watchfulness.</p>

<p>There was a strange softness in Captain Broom's
tread like that of a padding panther, but his arms
had the loose forward powerful swing of a gorilla's.
Once he stepped into the chart house to
look at something and the light of the lamp will
give us a square look at him.</p>

<p>"That man a pirate!" you exclaim at the first
glance; one who carried the blackest name along
the coast as a smuggler and wrecker, who had
brought cargoes of wretched slaves from Africa in
the days before the Civil War and who had had
more marvelous escapes than any man in the history
of piracy with the exception of Black Jack
Morgan! Impossible!</p>

<p>"Why that man is nothing but an old farmer,"
you exclaim in disappointment, when you see him.
"He ought to be peddling vegetables on market
day." But just wait.</p>

<p>True, Skipper Broom had come from a long line
of New England farmers, hard, close-fisted, close-mouthed
men. Young Broom had broken away from
the farm and followed his bent for sea-faring, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
to the end of his days, he kept his farmerlike appearance
and he affected many of the traits of the
yeoman which he found to be on more than one occasion
a most useful disguise.</p>

<p>Let's look at him. That heavy winter cap pulled
down on his grizzled head gives him a most "Reuben"
like appearance. Jeans pants are thrust into
heavy cowhide boots. The deadly gray eyes soft
as granite have become red rimmed from fits of
fury and hard through many scenes of coldly calculated
cruelty. A most dangerous customer and
I for one, and I ought to know, consider that he
will have the better of Jim Darlington in their approaching
encounter&mdash;and yet Jim is never beaten
until the last shot is fired and so it is impossible for
me to foretell how this contest of wit and daring
will come out.</p>

<p>After examining his chart closely, Captain Broom
crouched out through the door and on to the deck.
He took one keen look towards the shore, then he
approached the helmsman. "Git below, Bill. I'll
fetch her in."</p>

<p>The helmsman relinquished the wheel gladly
enough and under the Captain's masterful hand the
Sea Eagle swung slowly around and pointed
in towards the curving shore.</p>

<p>The dark form of the mate could be seen on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
deck below waiting for the order that he knew must
come soon. The crew of the Sea Eagle though
subordinate enough were necessarily partners in
Captain Broom's wicked enterprises so that the
discipline was somewhat different than in ordinary
vessels.</p>

<p>"Call 'em up, Mr. Haffen," roared the skipper to
the mate. "It's chore time."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir," replied Mr. Haffen.</p>

<p>The watch was called on deck and the dark forms
of the men could be seen in the bow. The pulsing
of the Sea Eagle had stopped and with scarcely a
sound the anchor was dropped into the water.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>THE COVE AND CAVE</h3>


<p>The starboard boat was lowered into the water.
First the mate, then Captain Broom and two men
got in. The latter were Cales and Pete who pulled
noiselessly at the oars. The boat glided quietly
through the silent darkness towards the shore.
The Captain was seated in the stern, his great bulk
crouched forward, but there was nothing inert in
his posture. His big hands clasped either side of
the craft.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the boat grounded softly on
the sand of the beach and all hands got ashore.
Scarcely a word was spoken, though the cove was
so hidden that there seemed to be no possible chance
that the landing of the free-booters would be observed.
However, Captain Bill Broom took no
risk of being discovered. He had many enemies
upon the coast and inland as well. Besides, the
State of California had set a price upon his head.</p>

<p>Two thousand dollars was the reward for his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
capture, and so profitable an investment was apt to
be realized on sooner or later by some enterprising
citizen. So Captain Broom took due care whenever
he went abroad not to attract undue attention.</p>

<p>This cove was a favorite lurking place of his
when close pressed, where he would take refuge
after some daring adventure upon the high seas, until
such a time as the hubbub along the coast had
died down. Sometimes he lay in hiding there, with
the Sea Eagle screened behind the encircling cliffs,
waiting like a black spider to rush out and capture
some unsuspecting craft.</p>

<p>"Pick her up, boys," said the Captain, "you know
where she belongs," pointing to the boat.</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir," they replied, and putting it on
their shoulders they carried the boat along a narrow
path that divided the thick undergrowth; until, after
going several hundred yards, they reached a thick
screen of brush through which they shoved, and
came to a cave.</p>

<p>Although so well hidden, the entrance to the
cavern was quite high, so that the men gained admission
without stooping, and going a short distance
into the dark interior, they placed the boat
gently down against the wall. There was a constant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
and heavy drip of water, so that there was no
chance for the boat to warp, as it would have surely
done if placed outside in the dry California air.</p>

<p>"I don't like this yere cave," remarked Pete,
when left alone with Cales.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with it? It's dark and damp,
but that is the nature of caves."</p>

<p>"It makes me feel creepy, that's all," replied Pete,
"and it takes considerable to do that."</p>

<p>"Whatever happened?" inquired Cales, grinning,
"something terrible, I reckon, to make your thick
hide chilly."</p>

<p>"It were before your time," replied Pete somewhat
reluctantly, "we raided a ranch back thar
agin the mountings. Senor Sebastian owned it
and it was said that he could ride all day and never
git off his place, and that he had more sheep and
cattle than thar is folks in Frisco."</p>

<p>"The Captain shanghied him, I reckon," cut in
Cales.</p>

<p>"You hold your windlass," commanded the old
man in a querulous tone, "I'm telling this yarn."</p>

<p>"All right, Pop," said Cales in a conciliating
manner, "have it yer own way." He was really
anxious to hear the story the old man had referred
to.</p>

<p>"Young fry is always flapping," the older speaker<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
mumbled,&mdash;then he took up the course of his narrative.
"Waal, as I was telling ye, this Senor had
lots of money and the Cap'n being short of funds
thought that he could use some of it. So one night
we ran into the cove, it was blacker even than this.
I don't see how the old man ever got the craft past
the sharks' teeth at the entrance but he did."</p>

<p>"He could have brought her in with his eyes
shut," declared Cales. "I never have seen his equal
for navigating."</p>

<p>"Waal, we made camp here that night, and the
next day, the Cap'n with some of the gang, left for
the ranch and I stayed to look after things. Nothing
happened that day, and I was dozing by the fire
about midnight when I heard them coming back.
They had the Senor, a fine-looking old man with a
gray mustache and as cold and proud-looking as
they make them.</p>

<p>"The Cap'n was furious because he had not been
able to lay his hand on the coin, and he swore that
he would make the old Senor tell where his money
was or there would be trouble. He took him into
this cave and I don't know what happened there,
and I don't want to know. All I'm sure of is that
I never saw him come out.</p>

<p>"The Cap'n sent me to the ship to get some
chains on the second day and he took 'em into the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
cave. We sailed a couple of days later, but not a
sign did I see of the Senor. That's why this cave
makes me creepy, Cales."</p>

<p>They were standing near the entrance, when there
came a distinct low moan from the interior. It
was not a ghostly sound, either. There was no
mistaking it.</p>

<p>"Did you hear that, Cales?" asked old Pete in a
quavering voice.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Cales, "I heard it all right. It
can't be the Senor?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Pete. "He has been dead these
years."</p>

<p>"Let's find out," said his comrade.</p>

<p>"There's nothing in this world could make me go
in thar," declared Pete solemnly, "besides, it's agin
the Captain's orders."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm going," said Cales either more brave
or less experienced than the other. "It sounds to
me like a woman's voice."</p>

<p>"And I'm goin' to git," declared old Pete, tottering
towards the path.</p>

<p>"You're a brave old pirate," said Cales contemptuously,
and with that he went slowly back into the
cave. He had to go cautiously, for beyond a certain
point he was not acquainted with the interior.
He could feel the moist ground under foot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
and he kept his hand stretched out, not knowing
what he might run against in the dense damp darkness.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, his hand struck a stone wall.
Groping his way, he turned a sharp corner and followed
along a low narrow passageway that obliged
him to stoop. Then came the sound of the moaning
just ahead. Jack Cales was a brave man but
it was all that he could do, to keep from turning
and running in panic for the mouth of the cave.
But though his determination had received a severe
shock, it did not turn to flight.</p>

<p>He saw a faint light ahead, spreading a glow at
the end of the passage as he came nearer. Then he
saw something that held him stone still with a
clutch of weird fear. He had reached the end of
the narrow passage, and dimly made out a domed
room in the rock, white with translucent encrustation.</p>

<p>He struck a match. About him, before, to the
right and to the left he could see forms all of
ghostly white, some crouching, others standing.
Hardly had the light flared up than it sizzled out.
Some drops of water falling from the roof had extinguished
the blaze. Then was repeated that
awful sound of distress.</p>

<p>Cales groped around almost in a frenzy of terror.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Where was the exit from that awful room? Round
and round he went, and all the time there were
strange whisperings in his ears, and unseen hands
seemed to clutch his clothes. Once he slipped and
was trembling so that he was hardly able to get to
his feet. Just as he did so, something swept past
him like a breath of wind. Rendered desperate he
made another dash, and this time if he had not
found a passageway, he felt that he could have
knocked a hole through the wall. Then he stood
at the mouth of the cave.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>THE BARBED WIRE</h3>


<p>Just at that moment was heard the hoarse voice
of Captain Broom booming through the darkness
outside.</p>

<p>As Cales turned about, some furry animal sprang
past him dashing between his legs and nearly upsetting
him.</p>

<p>"On deck, you scoundrel, come out of there,"
called the Captain.</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir," came the reply of Cales in a
strangely weak tone, though he was now more concerned
by the possible penalty to be meted out by
the Captain for disobedience of orders, than by
thought of the undetermined occupants of the cave.
If it were a cat it was certainly a good joke on old
Pete. This was, had they but known it, the swift
solution of the mystery.</p>

<p>Oddly enough the Captain said not another word,
a fact suggestive to Cales that there was something
amiss in the cave and the little company at once
took up their line of march. Captain Broom was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
in the lead, followed by the mate, then Cales, with
old Pete bringing up the rear. Just as they started
Captain Broom extinguished the lantern and they
took up the trail in total darkness. Every precaution
would now be necessary for they would soon
be in a region where the very name of Broom was
execrated with bitter hatred, and every bush would
grow a poniard if his whereabouts were known.</p>

<p>It was evident that the skipper was as good a
guide on land as he was a pilot at sea, for he led
his little party at a steady gait by a winding cow-path
through the thick undergrowth. He doubtless
knew this region thoroughly, for he had made
more than one raid in this locality.</p>

<p>It was soon to be determined, however, that they
were not the only ones abroad that night.</p>

<p>They had walked in silence for some time, well
on to two hours, when they came to an open space,
with the irregular form of a live oak on the southeast
corner. Then Captain Broom stopped suddenly,
his keen eyesight which no darkness could
baffle had discerned some object moving out from
the shelter of the oak tree.</p>

<p>It came slowly with uplifted black arms and
white hair falling around its face. There was a
terrible intensity in its advance across the open<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
space, withal that it moved so slowly. The figure
stopped directly in front of Captain Broom.</p>

<p>"Get out of my way, you hag," he roared, but for
the first time in his life a certain tremor crept into
his voice. Perhaps he was growing old. He drew
back his arm as though to strike the woman in his
path.</p>

<p>As he did so Jack Cales stooped and picked up a
round rock at his feet, intending to hurl it, not at
the woman but at the skipper, for he alone of the
party divined the possible cause of this poor
woman's dementia. But his interference was not
necessary for it seemed as though the Captain's
arm was paralyzed. He declared afterwards that
some invisible hand had seized his arm.</p>

<p>Then, in a loud, wailing voice the woman put a
curse upon the slayer of her husband, for this spectre
was none other than the Senora Sebastian. It
was terrible to hear her and it must have sent a
shiver into the soul of the hardy skipper.</p>

<p>When she had finished, the woman moved past
them and vanished in the direction of the ranch.
For a full minute the line of men stood without
moving a step and in absolute silence, Captain
Broom with his arm upraised as he had lifted it to
strike.</p>

<p>Then, without saying a word, he took the first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
forward step and the others followed him through
the darkness.</p>

<p>"Say, Cales," growled Pete in a low voice, "what
was it you found in that cave? My old timbers are
shaking yet."</p>

<p>"Keep your old jaws shut," yelled the Captain,
who had wonderfully keen hearing, when anything
was spoken that concerned him.</p>

<p>"How do you suppose the old man heard me?"
mumbled Pete to himself. He dropped back a pace
or two, then whispered, "The old man must be crazy.
He is making direct for the Sebastian ranch."</p>

<p>"Do you reckon that these four boys he is looking
after, are located there?" asked Jack.</p>

<p>"I dunno," replied Pete, "you can calkerlate on
one thing though and that is that the skipper knows
pretty nigh where those lads are. One of his messengers,
a one-eyed, twisted greaser, came aboard
the other day, and was gabbling in the Captain's
cabin. Then the next thing I knew we was under
sail, and came kiting down to the cove."</p>

<p>Just then the party halted at the confines of a four
strand barbed wire fence. This was the first indication
that they were entering the great ranch property
that formerly belonged to the Senor Sebastian,
the elderly man the Captain had made captive,
and which was now the property of his only son.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, lads," said the leader of the expedition,
"Here's a chance to make yourself small. This yere
barb is like a devil fish if it once gits a holt of your
panties&mdash;it won't let go."</p>

<p>"That's so, Captain," said the mate, a generally
silent and saturnine man.</p>

<p>"I reckon you know, mate," said the Captain.
"The last time we was through these parts, and that
some considerable years ago, this same fence got
a holt of yer pants and wouldn't let go. I never
heard you talk so much and so earnestly in my life
before. You want to be more keerful this time."</p>

<p>The mate simply grunted by way of reply and,
lying close to the ground, he very gingerly and
carefully worked his way under the wire and thus
escaped his mentioned former unpleasant detention.
He then held the lower wire up as high as he
could until his chief had wiggled under.</p>

<p>Pete was the only one of the party who was seriously
detained, for Jack Cales had slid under as
slick as an eel. But Pete's joints were old and
rusty and the venomous wire got a clutch on his
coat and his pants.</p>

<p>"What's keeping you back?" inquired the Captain,
gruffly, as Cales and his comrade did not put
in an immediate appearance.</p>

<p>"Pete has got caught, sir," said Jack.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>"What are you doing there, you old barnacle?"
inquired the Captain as he came back to the fence.</p>

<p>There was a certain odd comradeship between the
skipper and the old salt who had been with him
since his African days. Both were New Englanders
and had come from neighboring homesteads.</p>

<p>"Just resting, sir," replied the captive.</p>

<p>It certainly did have something of that appearance,
for Pete had kept a decisive grip on his old
black pipe with his stubby teeth and was puffing at
it in apparent peace and resignation.</p>

<p>"Want me to git you a piller?" inquired the
skipper, sarcastically.</p>

<p>"Thank ye, sir," replied Pete imperturbably.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the mate had been at work with deft
fingers and he finally succeeded in extricating the
old man and putting him upon his pins.</p>

<p>"Now if ye are sufficiently rested," proposed the
skipper, "we will hike along."</p>

<p>This they did. Their way now lay between two
stretches of fence that enclosed a road not much
traveled for there were only faint traces of wheels
in the turf. It was probably not a public highway
but belonged to the great ranch.</p>

<p>Everything seemed smooth sailing now, as there
was no more barbed wire to be immediately met but
Pete soon made himself prominent again. He was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
rolling along with that gait peculiar to a sailor when
aboard land, when he gave a sudden spring and
clutched Cales convulsively in the back, giving that
individual a big scare.</p>

<p>"Dad burn it, boys. I've stepped on a rattler."
An investigation was made very carefully and Captain
Broom quickly picked up a short piece of rope.</p>

<p>"I'll rattle you," he cried, touching up the old
man with the rope's end.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>PETE'S YARN</h3>


<p>They went along steadily through the darkness
in an almost directly easterly direction. Being now
clear of the brush they could make good time on the
springy turf.</p>

<p>"How far are we now from the ranch, Pete?" inquired
Jack.</p>

<p>"Too durn close to suit me," replied Pete. "I
can't tell exactly for these ranches are as big as all
outside creation, but I guess we must be as close as
a mile to the buildings."</p>

<p>"I reckon the Captain is going to walk up to the
front door and ask for accommodations."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't s'prise me a bit, if he done that," replied
Pete querulously. "The old man ain't lacking
in nerve. Back thar was the first time I ever seen
him hang back in my long experience with him."</p>

<p>"When the old lady was speaking her piece?
Suppose I ask him how much he made when he
captured the Senor," suggested Cales, who had recovered
his flippant humor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wouldn't git gay, lad," said old Pete, warningly.
"She is just as liable to haunt you in your
black spells."</p>

<p>"Don't have 'em, uncle," replied Cales.</p>

<p>"You collect the material for 'em when you are
young," said the old man wisely, "and they come
out of your bones like rheumatiz when you git old."</p>

<p>"Somebody is coming back of us," suddenly whispered
Cales.</p>

<p>"Take to cover, lads," ordered the skipper, who
was as quick to hear as the younger man. The only
cover was a high and thick growth of wild mustard
growing alongside the fences.</p>

<p>Quickly they stepped from the open road into the
shelter of the tall mustard. They had not long to
wait. There was the jingle of spurs and the thud
of horses' feet walking slowly along. Next came
the voices of men talking.</p>

<p>"It is useless, Senor, to try and find her, I fear,"
replied one man to the other.</p>

<p>"It seems so," replied the other sadly. "My
mother always seems to be worse when the time of
the year approaches that my father disappeared.
In spite of all our care she will escape."</p>

<p>They had now arrived at a point opposite where
the free-booters were hidden. The man who had
last spoken struck a light and lit a cigarette; the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
instantaneous glare showed the dark handsome face
of the Spanish type. There was the high-peaked
sombrero, the striking clothes, the intent face and
then the light died suddenly out.</p>

<p>"Ah, Manuel," said the young man to his companion,
"if I could only once lay hands on that
cursed Gringo," and he ground his teeth in fury,
unable to express himself.</p>

<p>"Humph, Gringo," grunted the Captain, disdainfully.</p>

<p>"Did you hear anything, Senor?" asked Manuel.</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"I was sure I heard something," asserted his
companion. They had reined in their horses and
sat listening quietly for a few seconds.</p>

<p>"It was probably nothing but a calf by the roadside,"
said the Senor.</p>

<p>The other shook his head doubtfully, then they
turned and rode on towards the rancho.</p>

<p>When they were safely out of range, the party
of pirates took up their line of march once more.</p>

<p>"So the greaser took me for a calf," remarked
Captain Broom. "If it had been you, Jack Cales,
there might be some excuse fer such a mistake."</p>

<p>"Aye, sir," replied Cales, glumly.</p>

<p>"Getting kind of close to the ranch, ain't you,
Cap'n?" ventured old Pete.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>"I thought of leaving you there, Pete, while the
rest of us corralled those kids. You are getting too
old for these long tramps."</p>

<p>No more remarks were heard coming from the
direction of Pete, for he was not at all sure but
that the Captain might, in a moment of irresponsible
humor, do just as he threatened without
regard to the consequences.</p>

<p>After they had gone on for a mile from the
point where the two men had overtaken them, Captain
Broom led his party away from the road in a
southerly direction, once more undergoing the harrowing
experience of getting through the barbed
wire fence. But this time Jack Cales was especially
detailed by the Captain to get old Pete through so
there would not be any unnecessary delay.</p>

<p>It was evident that they were getting into a different
section, a short time after they left the road, for
they began going up and winding among little
rocky hills. At last they came to a stopping place.
They climbed up an elevation and sat on some rocks
among a group of dark trees.</p>

<p>"Now, lads, take it easy," said the Captain, "ye
have had quite a footin' and when morning comes,
there will be some more ahead and at a faster gait."</p>

<p>"Gosh, Cap'n," declared old Pete, "It's the most
walking we've done together since the time we cor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>ralled
the last bunch of niggers on the west coast of
Africa."</p>

<p>"We certainly made money that trip when we sold
that cargo of coons to the traders on that Palmetto
Island below Charleston. But we will clean up
about as much money when we round up those four
boys and twice as easy. Tell the two lads about
that trip, Pete."</p>

<p>The old sailor sat on a rock, and taking out his
bag of tobacco filled his short black pipe with one
thorny thumb, then he commenced his narrative,
with the glow of his pipe lighting up his weatherbeaten
face.</p>

<p>"Well, orders is orders, and the Cap'n wants me
to tell this yarn. I might just as well begin it,
lads. I never knew any good to come to sailormen
cruising around on dry land any more than on this
trip." He cast a wary eye at Captain Broom, but
that worthy merely grunted and Pete resumed his
story.</p>

<p>"Our clipper lay at anchor in a wide bay with
only a couple of men on board and the Captain,
myself and six men trailing inland for to find a
village of naygurs that our guides had told us of.</p>

<p>"It certainly was hot and steamy going through
the jungles and every once in a while a big snake as
large as my leg would crawl across our path and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
rustle away into the undergrowth. Once I felt one
of 'em a-twisting and rolling under my foot like a
big log that had came to life. I guess I must have
jumped twice as high as my own head and I lit on
the back of one of the naygurs that was guiding us.</p>

<p>"He didn't know what struck him; probably
thought it was a tiger for I sunk my hooks into his
hide. He let out a yell and went ripping and snorting
through that jungle and me not having sense
enough to let go, until a grape vine about as thick
as a manilla rope chucked me under the chin and I
fell flat on my back and I guess that naygur is still
running."</p>

<p>Here the captain who was evidently enjoying the
narrative hugely, burst into a volcanic roar of
laughter.</p>

<p>"I can see yer yet, Pete, on that bounding buck
of a nigger, and him a-hiking through the jungle
and a-yelling like a wild Injun."</p>

<p>"I remember you got out of the way mighty
quick," said Pete, "when you heard us a-coming behind
you."</p>

<p>"It certainly was a curious spectacle," said the
Captain, "but go on with your yarn, Pete."</p>

<p>"The further we went into the jungle the worse
it got. The mosquitoes fairly ate us alive and they
wern't the only cannibals in those woods by any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
means. There was a tribe of man-eaters beyond the
Big River and we didn't try to capture any of them.
They wern't our stripe of bacon.</p>

<p>"We went on for six days, with the monkeys chattering
over our heads all day and the mosquitoes
serenading us at night. Talk about birds, there
was a whole menagerie of them and their colors
beat the handkerchiefs that these greasers wear
around their throats and you can't get ahead of that
for color.</p>

<p>"One night we got in range of the village we
were after and there was a great pow-wow going
on. There was a big fire in the circle of the grass
huts and some big black bucks were doing a dance
around it. Just then I saw&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold on, Pete," said the Captain in a low, gruff
voice, "somebody is coming our way."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>THE FOUR BOYS</h3>


<p>"Hey, Jim, where are we going to make camp?"
It was his brother Jo's genial voice.</p>

<p>"Not until we can strike water," replied Jim.
"No more dry camps for me."</p>

<p>"I don't think much of the coast range, or the
Sierras, either." It was Juarez Hoskins' well-remembered
voice, with its rather low, deep tones.</p>

<p>"Give me the Rockies every time."</p>

<p>Juarez was nothing if not loyal to his mountains.</p>

<p>"I don't think any of the mountains are much to
brag of."</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to say that it is Tom Darlington
who is now speaking, for the discerning
reader is pretty well acquainted with his style by
this time.</p>

<p>"There's always something to look out for," continued
Tom, "if it isn't Indians it's rattlesnakes,
and you have got to choose between a cloudburst or
no water at all. Give me the East every time."</p>

<p>"You make me exhausted talking about the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
East," said Jim. "Why didn't you stay there when
you were there? I had just as soon take a chance
with a rattlesnake as with an ice cream soda."</p>

<p>"Tom would like to <i>play</i> Indian," cut in Jo,
"with turkey feathers sticking up from a red flannel
band around his head. And creeping upon a flock
of sheep pretending that they are antelope and that
cows are real live bears."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Jim, "you have lined it out all right,
Jo. Then when they were tired of playing Injun,
Tom and his little playmates could pretend that
they were Daniel Boone's men with wildskin panties
on."</p>

<p>"Shut up, boys," said Juarez, coming to Tom's
rescue. "What's the use in rubbing it in? The
East is all right for some folks and if the boys back
there can't have real adventures they have to do the
best they can. After all, Jim, you are an Eastern
boy. You can't get away from that." Jim writhed
under the implication but replied good humoredly.</p>

<p>"You're right, Juarez, old chap, but I can't help
stirring up Tom once in a while. It is good for him
too. It keeps his liver active, so he won't get
bilious."</p>

<p>"Juarez has got more sense than you two put together,"
said Tom.</p>

<p>"Forget all about it now, Tommy," urged Juarez<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
good-naturedly, getting the aforesaid Tommy by
the nape of the neck with one vigorous brown hand
and giving him a shake.</p>

<p>Thus under Juarez's straightforward management
the family quarrel was abated.</p>

<p>"We might just as well ride now, boys," said
Jim. "The horses are good and rested and we will
soon be going down grade instead of up."</p>

<p>The horses had been following in single file back
of the four boys. They were to be trusted not to
cut up any shindigs or to wander from the narrow
mountain trail. The boys had had them a long time
and together they had gone through the numerous
hardships and adventures. They were as perfectly
trained as Uncle Sam's cavalry horses.</p>

<p>The horses halted as the boys dropped back to
their sides, and they swung into the saddle simultaneously.
Jim rode in the lead on a splendid gray,
with a powerful arching neck, strong shoulders and
hindquarters made for speed. Him, he called
Caliente. Next rode Tom on a pretty bay. Then
Jo on a black of medium size but finely built for
speed and endurance. Juarez brought up the rear
on his roan, a sinewy animal with a broncho strain
in him which was liable to crop out at unexpected
moments.</p>

<p>It is to be noticed that there was a certain forma<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>tion
in the way the column rode. Jim, the strong and
resourceful in front, and Tom, the less experienced
and capable, following, forming the first division.
The second division was composed of Jo and Juarez.</p>

<p>Juarez having an equally important position with
the leader, for he was rear guard, a more trying
position sometimes than being in front for in their
travels through dangerous regions, it was the man
in the rear who was more apt to be cut off by the
wily Indians. But the cool and crafty Juarez was
not likely to be caught napping.</p>

<p>Even now you notice as they ride along through
the comparatively safe region of the coast range
that Jim and Juarez are ever on the alert, glancing
this way and that, halting to examine some peculiar
mark on the trail, and not a motion of tree or
bush upon either mountain slope escapes their
attention. They had lived too long in the midst
of treacherous enemies, Indians and outlaws, to be
taken off their guard. They had been in Mexico
on a venture the outcome of which was all their
fondest dreams could wish for. Their expedition
over, Tom was for going home, to at least deposit
the treasure they had gained, but the others had
outvoted him, and now the long pleasure trip to
Hawaii was their object.</p>

<p>Now, if they but had known it, they were riding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
to meet the most deadly danger that they had yet
encountered. For as you know, Captain Broom
and his party were advancing to meet them. In an
open or running fight, we know perfectly well that
the boys could take care of themselves, but in the
skipper of the Sea Eagle, they were to meet a far
more dangerous opponent than in Eagle Feather,
described in "The Frontier Boys in Colorado" or
Cal Jenkins in Kansas and in Mexico as detailed in
"Overland Trail" and in "Mexico." In compliance
with a determined plan, they were now on their way
to Hawaii.</p>

<p>Not only had Captain Broom the craftiness and
cruelty of the Indian, but the cool, hard judgment
of the New England Yankee, coupled with a knowledge
of their possessions, supposedly limited to
themselves alone. The Mexican spy, who had reported
the route the boys were going to take, had
given the game into his master's hands.</p>

<p>"I wonder what has become of our one-eyed
greaser friend," said Jim, "we haven't seen any
sign of him since he gave us the shake a week ago
at the hunting camp. I kind of thought we might
run across him again."</p>

<p>"It's good riddance to bad rubbish," said Juarez
in a surly tone. "If I had my way I'd hang him to
the first oak tree on general principles and on ac<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>count
of his personal appearance. I bet he is a
treacherous little rat."</p>

<p>"He isn't very pretty, that's a fact," admitted Jim,
"but he is a useful little beast about the camp and
can do a lot of chores."</p>

<p>"I kind of like to hear him play his guitar," put
in Jo, "and sing those Mexican tunes. They certainly
sound pretty."</p>

<p>"He's a picturesque beggar too," remarked Tom.
"Just the kind that in the old days would have been
made a king's jester. They dressed 'em up in a
blazing bright style then. That hump would have
made his fortune."</p>

<p>Tom, as you remember, was an authority on
Romance, and as pertaining to which he always
carried two favorite volumes, much worn by hard
travel and frequent usage, but which no amount of
ridicule by his brothers could make him give up.</p>

<p>"Have it your own way," acceded Juarez, "but
he is not the sort of animal that I would recommend
for a household pet."</p>

<p>"Well, he is gone," said Jim, "so we don't need
to worry about him."</p>

<p>"I don't know but that I would a little rather have
him in sight," said Juarez. "Then you know where
he is."</p>

<p>Jim laughed good-naturedly at the prejudice that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Juarez showed against the little greaser and put it
down to his darkly suspicious nature acquired by his
life among the Indians. It would have been better
if Jim had taken more stock in his comrade's suspicions.
Now, Jim was not to be caught napping
when once an enemy had declared himself, but it
was his nature to be open-minded and unsuspicious.</p>

<p>The four Frontier Boys were riding up a winding
trail through a narrow mountain valley, having
reached a point almost level with the summits,
which rose several thousand feet above the eastern
plain. It had been a hard, all day climb, and the
horses were tired and the gray dust was caked upon
their sweaty riders.</p>

<p>Let us take a look at our old acquaintances, Jim,
Tom, Jo and Juarez, to see if they have changed
any since we saw them last. They are dressed
about as we have always known them. In gray
flannel shirts and pants of the same color, moccasins
on their feet and on their heads battered sombreros
with the flaps turned back.</p>

<p>Their coats are tied back of the saddles, and their
shirts open at the throat for the air is hot and dry
in that California mountain valley. Their rifles are
swung across their shoulders held by straps, revolvers
in the holsters at their hips.</p>

<p>Jim sits in the saddle tall and sinewy, grown<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
somewhat thinner by constant exercise and by the
drying effect of the desert air. His skin is baked
to an absolute brown. Juarez, too, is black as an
Indian and he rather looks like one with his hair
quite long and of a coarse black fibre. The boys
look a little fine-drawn but sinewy and strong and
fit for any adventure.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>THE HUNCHBACK</h3>


<p>The shadows were already falling on that side of
the range as the boys rode slowly into a narrow
pass. The shade was a decided relief from the
glare of the California sun that they had encountered
all day.</p>

<p>"Gosh, but I should like to have a cool breath
from the Rockies," declared Juarez with emphasis,
"This sort of a climate makes me tired. Nothing
but the sun staring at you all the time. It goes
down clear and comes up with the same kind of a
grin on its face."</p>

<p>"It will be cooler when we get on the other side,"
said Jim, encouragingly, "and it won't be long
now."</p>

<p>"I hope we will strike water on the other side,"
remarked Jo. "I'm tired of looking at that bald-headed
stream down there," indicating the dry
blistered bed of a former water-course.</p>

<p>Nothing more was said until of a sudden they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
rode to the top of the Pass, and saw a new landscape
spread out before them.</p>

<p>It was a broad and beautiful view, with the sun
striking the wide Pacific, with a blazing glare of
silver and below the wooded slope of the mountains,
stretched an apparently level plain, where roamed
countless cattle, and innumerable sheep. It had all
the breadth characteristic of the Californian landscape.</p>

<p>"That's a pretty good looking view," remarked
Jim admiringly. He would have been still more interested
if he could have seen a trim-looking black
vessel in a small cove directly west but a good many
miles distant.</p>

<p>"I wonder if it isn't going to rain," said Tom.
"See those clouds rolling in over the ocean."</p>

<p>"Rain!" ejaculated Jim with superior wisdom,
a wisdom that appertains particularly to older
brothers, "I guess not. Those are fog clouds.
That's a sure sign in this country that it won't
rain."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad to see them, anyway," said
Juarez. "It looks sort of stormy even if it isn't."</p>

<p>It was restful, there was no question about that,
the change from the constant glare of a white sun
in a blue sky, to the soft damp grayness of the fog.
It was already rolling over the level plain towards<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
the mountains and, in a short time, a high fog was
spread over the whole sky.</p>

<p>The boys had ridden down the western side of
the range for a distance of a half mile, when Jim
suddenly waved his hand backward in a sign of caution
for the column to halt. He leaned forward,
looking intently in a northwesterly direction to a
point on the opposite side of the mountain valley.
Juarez followed the direction of the leader's look
with a keen gaze.</p>

<p>"I was sure that I saw some one slipping through
the undergrowth on the opposite side over there,"
Jim finally said, "but I could not make sure whether
it was a man or some sort of animal."</p>

<p>"I noticed the bushes shaking," said Juarez, "but
I did not see anything."</p>

<p>"Might have been a brown bear," hazarded Jo.</p>

<p>"They do have them in this range," put in Tom.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is the bear that we hunted for two
days on the other slope," said Juarez, "and he has
come to give himself up."</p>

<p>"We had better keep our eyes open," advised
Jim, though he did not take the trouble to unsling
his rifle. "Jo, you and Tom watch the upper side,
Juarez will take care of the trail in front."</p>

<p>"All right, boss," said Juarez, cheerfully.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>"How much reward, captain, for the first glimpse
of the lost child?" inquired Jo.</p>

<p>Jim paid no attention to this sally, but kept his
eye on the trail ahead. The trees were quite thick
on either side of the trail and as dusk was coming
on, it was difficult to make out any object clearly.</p>

<p>Just as Jim rode around a turn in the trail,
Caliente reared and leaped to one side and a less
skillful rider would have been thrown.</p>

<p>"Easy, old boy," said the rider, patting his horse's
neck. Caliente stood trembling and snorting and
watching a curious object that was struggling up
the bank towards the trail.</p>

<p>It was hard to tell what it was, whether man or
beast and the dusk only served to make it more obscure.
Then the object scrambled up on to the
trail and Jim at once recognized the dwarf Mexican
with his high-crowned sombrero and his velvet
suit richly slashed. With his crooked back and one
eye, he was anything but a prepossessing-looking
creature. Caliente, when he, too, recognized who
it was, put back his ears and rushed with bared
teeth for the Mexican.</p>

<p>Spitting out a curse, the greaser jumped to one
side with a marked agility, and Jim succeeded after
a struggle in bringing his furious steed to terms,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
but he had his hands full and there were not very
many men who could manage Caliente when he got
into one of his rages.</p>

<p>"Hi! Manuel," (every Mexican was Manuel to
the boys), cried Jim, "look out for my Tiger, he
wants to eat that velvet suit of yours."</p>

<p>"Si, Senor," called Manuel from a safe station
on a granite rock. "He is a tiger as your Honor
says."</p>

<p>One would have expected to hear the crooked
little greaser speak in a harsh croaking voice, but
instead it had a rich sonorous quality.</p>

<p>"Do you know where there is any water in this
country?" asked Jo. "We are as dry as a desert."</p>

<p>"Certainly, Senor, I will show you," replied
Manuel. (It was true that Manuel spoke in Spanish
of which language the boys had a working
knowledge, due to their sojourn in the southwest.
But I shall put his words in English.) "Where is
Senor Juarez?" inquired the dwarf. "I do not see
him."</p>

<p>"The Senor is still with us," replied Jim, gravely,
"but you cannot see him on account of the dusk,
but you might hear him," he added in a lower
tone.</p>

<p>It was true that Juarez was growling to himself
about the greaser for whom you know he had a cor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>dial
antipathy, a feeling which was reciprocated by
the Mexican.</p>

<p>"Lead on, Manuel," urged Jim, "we want to
make camp before morning."</p>

<p>"But, Senor, the tiger will eat me up," objected
the Mexican.</p>

<p>"I will take care of Caliente. He won't bite you.
Go ahead."</p>

<p>"Si, Senor," assented Manuel.</p>

<p>Then he jumped down from the rock and took
the trail at a discreet distance ahead of Jim's
horse, who was held in check by his rider though his
temper seemed in no wise abated. There was
something sinister in the figure of the Mexican as
he led the way down the trail.</p>

<p>All in black, except the gray of his hat with its
golden cord and the tinsel of his clothes. There
was something malignant in his make-up and even
the unimaginative Jim was affected by the presence
of the Mexican, while Juarez was very uneasy, and
asked Jo and Tom to allow him to move up next
to the Captain. This they did, though it left Jo as
rear guard on that rocky trail.</p>

<p>He seemed quite isolated but he had become sufficiently
enured to danger and though he kept a
wary eye, he was not nervous. The boys had unholstered
their pistols and Juarez kept a straight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
eye on the moving shadow in the darkness ahead.
At the first sign of attack or treachery, he was
going to get that particular Manuel.</p>

<p>"I've got my eye on the little varmint," said
Juarez in a low voice to Jim. "He may be leading
us into an ambush."</p>

<p>"Oh, I guess not," said Jim, with a note of hesitation
in his voice. "We have got to find water anyway.
The horses are suffering for it, and this
beggar can show us where we can locate it."</p>

<p>Just then Manuel threw up his hand with a shrill
whistle that had every malignant intention in it.
Juarez raised his pistol just ready to fire, when
the Mexican laughed shrilly.</p>

<p>"Senor Juarez very nervous. I just stretch and
whistle a little and he want to shoot."</p>

<p>A peculiar smile came over Juarez's face, but he
said nothing. All the stolid Indian in his nature
came to the surface. He merely grunted contemptuously
at the Mexican's remark and this made
the volatile Manuel uneasy in his turn, for he
wanted to realize that his malice had struck home,
but Juarez did not give him that satisfaction.
There was a sort of hidden duel between these two,
the subtle Mexican and the crafty Indian nature of
Juarez. It remained to be seen who would win.</p>

<p>The four Frontier Boys went silently along down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the dark canyon, each one occupied with his own
thoughts and the ill-omened Mexican guide in the
lead. Juarez kept a sharp lookout on either side
of the trail expecting an ambush. His horse seemed
to feel something of the strain his rider was under,
as a horse will. Once he shied at something he saw
in a clump of bushes, and nearly went off the trail.
It was only with the aid of Juarez's horsemanship
that he clawed his way back to safety. The Mexican
was much amused at this incident, and Jim
gave him a sharp call down.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>FARMER BROOM</h3>


<p>We must now return to Captain Broom and his
escort, whom we left sitting on a hill covered with
trees near the Sebastian rancho. Old Pete's story
had been interrupted by the skipper's warning,&mdash;"Somebody
is coming our way."</p>

<p>There was no question about that, they could
hear the someone coming towards the hill whistling
cheerfully. Then the form of a man could be seen,
coming up the slope of the elevation.</p>

<p>"I wonder where those altogether blessed cows
are," he was heard saying in Spanish, but of course,
this is a free and not a literal translation.</p>

<p>"They are generally hiding under these trees,"
he continued. The sailors kept absolutely still and
old Pete covered the bowl of his pipe with his hand
so that its light might not discover them.</p>

<p>"Carambe!" cried the Mexican as he stopped
about three feet from the recumbent Captain, "I
fear my good master's cows have been smoking,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
not like nice Mexican cows, a cigarette, but a pipe
like a vile gringo. Come, get up, you black
brute," noticing the big bulk of the Captain for the
first time, and he hauled off and gave the skipper a
hearty kick on the haunch.</p>

<p>Never was there a more surprised greaser in the
whole ungainly length of California for this apparently
gentle cow that he kicked, (not for the first
time either) suddenly turned and grabbed him with
a powerful hand before he could yell, though he
was so frightened that he probably could not utter
a squeak. Another hand got him by the throat.</p>

<p>"Take me for a cow, did you, you bespangled
Manuello?" roared the Captain, and he waved the
aforesaid Manuello about in his great grip as
though he had been a rag.</p>

<p>"No use killing the beggar, Captain," said the
mate. "Maybe he can tell us something." The
Captain let the Mexican drop and he lay on the
ground perfectly inert.</p>

<p>"He won't be able to say much right away," said
the Skipper.</p>

<p>It was now getting light, the first signs of dawn
showing above the mountains. As the darkness
was drawn away, they could see their position more
clearly and there came the sounds of the morning
from the direction of the ranch houses. The bark<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>ing
of dogs, the crowing of roosters, and the call
of human voices.</p>

<p>"I guess, lads, it's about time for us to have
something to eat," said the Captain, "because we
have got to do some tall climbing today and I want
to get an early start."</p>

<p>An expression of disgust showed itself on old
Pete's face at the idea of more walking, which the
Captain was quick to note.</p>

<p>"How would you like to stay here, Old Bones,
and look after Manuello?" said the skipper. But
Pete shook his head.</p>

<p>"I'll stay by the ship, Cap'n," said the old fellow
stoutly.</p>

<p>"Durn my buttons," said the Captain, whose
oaths were as mild as his actions were vicious,
"if you ain't a good old barnacle, Pete. I
wouldn't think of leaving you in such company as
this," and he gave the prostrate Mexican a shove
with his foot. Manuello looked up at the Captain
with an evil eye and a muttered curse.</p>

<p>This roused the fury of Captain Broom and he
held him off from the ground as if he had been
a rat, his jaws working ominously and a look in his
eyes that made the Mexican shrivel.</p>

<p>Nothing was said, not even by the Skipper, and
the others watched him fascinated as he glared at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
his victim, and even the iron composure of the
saturnine mate seemed to be moved partially aside.
The Mexican began to whimper and moan as his
eyes shifted to avoid the terrible ones of the Captain.
He was not suffering any special violence,
but a strange tremor filled the soul of the Mexican,
in the grip of the grizzled giant.</p>

<p>As the greaser began to cry, the Captain gave a
roar of laughter and threw him aside upon the
ground, about all the humanity he had shriveled
out of him. He lay there absolutely without any
power of motion in his body.</p>

<p>Just then the crew of the Sea Eagle became
aware of the fact that a horned animal with big
brown eyes was looking at them. All the farmer
in the nature of Captain Broom came to the surface.</p>

<p>"By Gum," he exclaimed, "if here ain't a bovine
cow looking at us. I ain't milked one for forty
years, but I'm not afeard to try. 'Member, Pete,
when we used to milk the cows back in old Connecticut
on the farm. After working in the hay all
day, I'd go down in the side hill pasture, that was
so steep that you had to hold on with your toes and
your teeth to keep from sliding down to the
brook."</p>

<p>"You bring it back to me just like it was a liv<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>ing
picture," said Pete, his hard face softening under
the gentle showers of memory.</p>

<p>"Then I'd drive the black and white one that
was breechy, and the red mooley, the yaller and
white that gave the richest milk. I'd drive them
into the stanchions in the old barn, with the ground
floor stoned up on the side, where it was sunk into
the hill."</p>

<p>"But it was winter, Cap'n," said Pete, "that it was
interesting doing the chores," and he blew reminiscently
on his fingers, "snow two feet on the level
and the sun a piece of blue ice in the sky. A condemned
sight better place than Californey, where
you don't feel no more alive than a enbalmed
corpse."</p>

<p>The Captain began now a series of man&#339;uvres to
get within range of one of the cows so that they
might have fresh milk for breakfast. He managed
it finally, and he certainly looked like a peaceful
old farmer as with his gray head against a fat red
cow's flank, he milked into a large tin cup. Pete selected
a black mooley and soothed by the man's
persuasive manner, she consented finally to give
down a thin blue stream. But the saturnine mate
was less successful as he knew much more about
navigating a ship than he did about cows.</p>

<p>Finally after much awkward man&#339;uvring, he got<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
a cow cornered and began operations upon the left
side with the result that the cow landed upon him
with her hoof and sent him sprawling on his back
to the great delight of the Captain.</p>

<p>"Hurt bad, Bill?" inquired the Skipper with mock
sympathy, "I'm afeard that you will never make a
farmer."</p>

<p>"I never calkerlated to," replied the mate. "It
ain't my line of business."</p>

<p>"Don't tell me that," said the Captain, "I can see
that for myself. Come up here and I'll give you a
drink."</p>

<p>They had scarcely finished their simple breakfast
when Jack Cales gave a sudden alarm.</p>

<p>"Cap'n," he cried, "I see two men legging it our
way. They are making straight for the hill."</p>

<p>"I guess they are coming to see why Manuello
doesn't show up with the cows," remarked the Captain,
"we don't want to stir up this hen roost as
we've got other chicken to fry. So we'll git."</p>

<p>"Take the greaser?" inquired Jack.</p>

<p>"You and the mate fetch him," said the Captain.</p>

<p>Just as the two men were mounting the hill, the
Captain and his crew made a swift sneak down the
opposite slope, and were soon making their way
through the bush towards the foot-hills. In a minute
they heard the cries of the two men as they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
drove the herd of cows towards the home ranch for
the morning milking. The sun had now risen
above the eastern range just in front of them and
was blazing down upon the plain and the sea
beyond. There was something exhilarating in the
air in spite of the heat.</p>

<p>"We don't need the company of that greaser any
further," said Captain Broom, after they had made
some headway up a canyon back of the ranch buildings.
So they took some rope grass, tough as
manilla, and tied him firmly, and, after having
gagged him, they left him to be found later by
some of his countrymen.</p>

<p>Then they toiled steadily up the trail of the
canyon, until about noon they reached a pocket in
the canyon where there was a pool of clear water
fed by an invisible spring. Coming to meet them
were four boys riding up the trail on the other
side of the range.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>THE CAMP IN THE POCKET</h3>


<p>Under the guidance of the Mexican dwarf, the
four boys came at last to a halt. It seemed as if
the canyon down which they had been riding had
come to an end for there was a wall of rock directly
in front of them.</p>

<p>"Down there, Senor, is a pool of clear water,"
announced the Mexican.</p>

<p>"Glad to hear it, Manuel," said Jim heartily.</p>

<p>"Did you ever see a picture, Jim," put in Juarez
significantly, "of a pool where the thirsty animals
have to come to drink and before they get their
noses in the water the hunter shoots them?"</p>

<p>But nothing of this dire nature happened and in
a few minutes the famished animals were pumping
the delicious water down their long, baked
throats.</p>

<p>"My Gracious, but that tastes good!" cried Tom,
drawing in a long, gasping breath, after he had
been drinking steadily for about a minute. "It
makes my head swim."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>"I should think it would," said Jo, sarcastically,
"considering the amount you have drunk."</p>

<p>"You weren't far behind," grumbled Tom. "I
thought that you were not going to leave enough
for the horses."</p>

<p>"I don't especially like this place to camp in,"
said Jim. "We are not accustomed to get in a
pocket like this. But it is too late to pull out tonight
and the horses need a rest, so we will keep
guard."</p>

<p>"Better drown the brown rat first," remarked
Juarez to Jim. But the latter only shook his head
and laughed.</p>

<p>The camp was made about twenty feet east of
the spring in a small grove of slender trees backed
by a high wall of steep granite, down which poured
a waterfall in the rainy season.</p>

<p>The fire was built upon a flat rock in the centre
of the grove where there was no danger of it catching
in the grass and bushes which were dry as tinder.
If once a mountain fire was started at the end
of the dry season there would be no stopping it
until it had devastated the whole country.</p>

<p>The light of the fire showed the usual cheery and
active scene that goes with making camp. How
many times the Frontier Boys had gone through
these preparations it is impossible to say. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
had camped on the plains of Kansas, in the mountains
of Colorado, on the Mesas of New Mexico,
the banks of the Colorado river, and the Pampas
of Mexico. Now we find them in the coast range
of California.</p>

<p>It was not an especially dangerous country in
which they were camped, nothing to compare with
parts of Colorado and Mexico, but never were they
in greater danger than at the present moment and
this camp promised to be their last together, except
they had unusual luck.</p>

<p>There was a traitor in the company, and even
now four pairs of hostile eyes were watching them
as they moved in the light of the fire. The Captain
of the Sea Eagle and his three trusty men were
hidden in some bushes at the top of the pocket on
the western side.</p>

<p>Juarez and Jim busied themselves first in looking
after their horses. Removing the saddles they
rubbed down each animal thoroughly, clear to the
fetlocks and then gave them a good feed of grain.
Jo and Tom were on the supper committee and busying
themselves making preparations for a square
meal. Manuello, who had been with the boys on
the other side of the range and was accustomed to
help in odd chores about camp, now offered to aid
in getting the supper.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will make the coffee with your permission,
Senor Jo," he proposed.</p>

<p>"Do you savvy it all right, Manuello?" inquired
Jo.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, Senor. I can make such coffee as the
Holy Father would be pleased to drink," he replied
with fervor.</p>

<p>"Not too strong because it keeps me awake," protested
Tom.</p>

<p>"No, no, Senor Thomas," replied Manuello
with a sweeping bow, "the coffee I make is very
soothing. It will give you a long, soft sleep."
There was an undertone of subtle irony that was
entirely lost upon the two straightforward boys.</p>

<p>"That's a good fellow, Manuello," said Jo, cordially,
and he handed the coffee pot filled with
water to the Mexican, who went about the preparation
of it with a deftness that showed that he knew
what he was about. Not one of the boys saw him
slip a white powder into the coffee pot. It quickly
dissolved and the coffee began to bubble innocently
enough under the eyes of the hunchback Manuello.</p>

<p>Juarez and Jim just then came back from looking
after the horses which were fastened near the wall
of rock. As soon as Juarez saw the Mexican
watching over the coffee pot, his eyes narrowed
with suspicion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who made the coffee?" he asked Jo, bluntly.</p>

<p>"Manuello," replied Jo.</p>

<p>"The Senor will find the coffee truly delicious,"
said the hunchback with a bow, "only the Mexican
knows how to keep its aroma when boiling it."</p>

<p>"Humph," grunted Juarez, and he went deliberately
to the fire and lifted the coffee pot off and
poured its contents on the ground.</p>

<p>"The American does not care for the aroma of
your Mexican coffee," he said coolly.</p>

<p>The Mexican merely gave a peculiar hitch to his
shoulder, spat on the ground and turned away apparently
mortally offended as he, no doubt, was.
That part of his scheme had been blocked by the
craftiness of Juarez, but the Captain might make
good where his spy had failed.</p>

<p>The Mexican sat back in the shadow on a rock
smoking a cigarette, while the boys ate their
supper of beans, meat, bread and coffee. He was
the skeleton at the feast as it were, not only his
malignant humor made itself felt, but there was a
sense of depression that they could not shake off,
try as they would.</p>

<p>This was so unusual that they could not account
for it. As a rule, they were jolly and even when
danger was impending, they felt a certain confidence
and assurance, but not so tonight.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>"What makes us feel so on the bum tonight, do
you suppose?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"Maybe this canyon is haunted," proposed Jo,
who had an imaginative streak in him.</p>

<p>"I tell you the way I figure it," said Jim. "We
are not used to camping in a hollow like this, for
before this we have always selected a place that
we could defend, and though there is no particular
danger from outlaws or Indians in these mountains,
we can't shake off our old habits."</p>

<p>"I believe there is something in that," acquiesced
Jo.</p>

<p>"It's that rat over there," said Juarez loudly.</p>

<p>The Mexican laughed coolly and insolently, and
lighted another cigarette. This would have maddened
an excitable person, but Juarez was in a
stoical mood and he contented himself with flinging
a bone that he had been gnawing at, carelessly
over his shoulder, almost striking the Mexican in
the face.</p>

<p>This set that peppery individual wild and he tore
around considerably, tearing his hair, stamping his
feet and sputtering with maledictions at the insult
that had been offered him.</p>

<p>"I am no dog that you can throw a bone to,"
and he sizzled off into a string of unpleasant remarks.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>"Here you, Manuello," roared Jim, rising to his
feet and standing over the Mexican, "not another
yelp out of you."</p>

<p>Manuello had a respect for this big American
lad much as he despised his simplicity and he
sobered down. Besides he had not finished his
work for the night. He had failed to get the sleeping
drug to the boys in the coffee and now he must
be ready to help his master, Captain Broom of the
Sea Eagle, in some other way.</p>

<p>There was a person whom he feared and admired
absolutely and he had been a most useful spy and
agent for the Skipper in certain nefarious plots.
It was well for the little hunchback that no one
knew of his share in the betraying of old Juan Sebastian
some years before.</p>

<p>"You will have the first watch, Jo," ordered Jim.
"It is now nine o'clock. I will relieve you at
eleven and stand guard until two. Juarez from
two until five and Tom can have the short watch."</p>

<p>According to this arrangement, Jim and Juarez
would be on guard during the danger hours.</p>

<p>How many times in the past had the boys stood
guard over their camp. Was this to be the last
guard? There were the old Kansas days, when
they had to be on the watch against horse thieves.
Then came the dangerous crisis in their Colorado<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
experiences, when they had to guard against the
wiles of the Indians. And most exciting of all,
perhaps, the night in old Mexico when they camped
on the trail of the outlaws. I wonder if Jo, the
first on duty, thought of these old times that night.
Probably not, his mind being fully occupied with
the business in hand.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>THE ATTACK</h3>


<p>So the three boys rolled into their blankets with
the saddles for pillows and dropped immediately to
sleep as they were very tired from the long, hard
ride. They lay at different points around the fire,
which was allowed to die down as the fog seemed
like a warm gray blanket over the whole landscape.</p>

<p>Jo sat on a log by the slowly dying fire, with his
rifle on his knees looking into the darkness and not
far from him lay the Mexican a mere dark lump
on the ground, apparently asleep, but keeping a
wary eye on all around. Imperceptibly he crept
nearer to where Jo was sitting, but he did not have
the weapon he would have preferred in his hand,
the stiletto, which was as natural to him as the
fangs to a rattlesnake.</p>

<p>But it did not suit the long-headed Captain
Broom to have the boys killed. He wanted their
life as well as their money, but in a different sense
than the adage has it. From what he had heard of
them, they were boys of unusual mettle and varied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
acquirements. If caught young, he could train
them to good purpose. If they proved worthless,
he would hold them for ransom.</p>

<p>So Captain Broom had told Manuello briefly and
to the point that there was to be no rib-sticking and
the Mexican would have thought as soon of disobeying
the commands of the Evil One as of going
contrary to the instructions of the Captain. So as
he crept towards Jo, he held not a poniard in his
clenched hand, but a heavy weapon like a black-jack,
made of leather with a weight at the end.</p>

<p>Jo, however, spoiled his first attempt, for when
the greaser had got within striking distance, Jo got
up and went down to the pool to get a drink. If it
had not been so dark, when they arrived, the boys
would have seen tracks around the pool that would
have aroused their suspicions. But everything
seemed to work against them this time.</p>

<p>Jo stooped down at the brink and scarcely put
his thirsty lips to the water when some instinct of
warning made him look quickly around and he saw
a small dark object directly back of him.</p>

<p>"Pardon, Senor, for startling you;" it was the
voice of the dwarf, "but I, too, was very thirsty. It
is in the air."</p>

<p>"You needn't have been so quiet about it," said
Jo, crossly. This little rat always had a way of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
baffling and irritating him, because he did not have
Jim's force, which could beat down the dwarf when
occasion demanded it, or the stoicism of Juarez,
which blocked the hunchback.</p>

<p>"I came softly, Senor," said the Mexican, imperturbably,
"because I did not wish to disturb the
slumbers of the Senors who are resting."</p>

<p>"Get down and drink, then," said Jo, who,
though he realized that the Mexican was up to
some hidden deviltry, did not know how to meet
him. Jim and Juarez would have knocked him out
of the camp if they had discovered him trailing
them, with a warning that he would be shot if he
put in an appearance again.</p>

<p>While the Mexican was pretending to drink, Jo
satisfied his thirst at a point of the pool where he
would be safe from a sudden attack by the hunchback.
For Jo was not a fool by any means. Then
he got to his feet and with the Mexican ahead of
him, he saw to that, he made his way back to the
camp.</p>

<p>Scarcely had Jo seated himself upon the rock
again than he heard a stick snap upon the mountain
side above the horses, so he got to his feet to investigate.</p>

<p>"You can stay where you are, Manuello," said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Jo. "I don't need your company this time." The
Mexican laughed softly to himself.</p>

<p>"I hope the Senor Americano will not get lonesome,"
he said.</p>

<p>Jo made a careful search in the direction of the
sound but found no sign of a human being lurking
among the trees. Though he felt exceedingly
nervous, he was unable to account therefor or give
a reason.</p>

<p>Very quietly he went the rounds, so as not to
awake the boys, who, however, were sleeping heavily.
He found the horses all right standing with
drooping heads as though dozing, Jo's black with
his neck over Tom's bay, as these horses were
great chums. But Caliente and Juarez's roan were
not sociable and kept strictly to themselves.</p>

<p>Then Jo returned to the rock where he had been
sitting. He stirred the dying fire so that it sent up
a feeble spurt of flame by the aid of which he
looked at his watch. It lacked a few minutes of
ten. The Mexican had taken up his old place on
the ground watching for his chance. He was
anxious that the attack should take place during
Jo's watch for he had his doubts in regard to
Juarez or the redoubtable Jim proving easy victims.</p>

<p>All this time, Captain Bill Broom and his crew
had been keeping watch upon their intended victims<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
from the top of the cliff above the pool. They
could see every move from the time the Frontier
Boys had arrived until they lay down near the
smouldering fire.</p>

<p>"They are a husky lot," was the Captain's first
comment. "That tall fellar, I guess, is a horse
tamer and Injun fighter."</p>

<p>Some time later when the altercation occurred
about the coffee and Juarez expressed his opinion
about the Mexican, the Captain could scarcely keep
from haw-hawing right out.</p>

<p>"Them fellars have got some dis'pline," commented
the saturnine mate.</p>

<p>"You're right they hev," said the Captain.</p>

<p>"That lad don't know how to handle my pet
rattlesnake," was the Captain's comment when the
Mexican trailed Jo to the drinking pool. After
Jo had returned from making his rounds and had
resumed his guard again, the Captain decided that
the time had come for action.</p>

<p>"Now, lads," he ordered, "pull off your shoes
and the first man that makes a sound will get his
neck cracked. Knock 'em out, if necessary, but
no killing this time."</p>

<p>Then they started, the Captain in the lead, and
old Pete bringing up the rear. They had had a
good many hours in that vicinity and had made a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
path from their hiding place to the soft dust trail.
So they moved in their sock feet without a sound.
There was an oppressive stillness in that dark canyon
under the heavy blanket of fog.</p>

<p>Already it had began to lower and as the sailors
advanced with snail-like slowness the heavy white
fog settled down, filling the canyon with its white
opaqueness. You could not see five feet in front,
and the moisture beaded itself upon the eyebrows
and mustaches of the men.</p>

<p>This dense fog was a great help to the attacking
party. They had now crawled half way down
the main trail, when Pete came near putting all the
fat in the fire, for his eyesight was not overly keen,
and the fog made it more difficult for him. He did
not see a round stone poised on the edge of the
trail until it rolled down towards the pool.</p>

<p>Although every sound was deadened by the fog,
still the watchful Jo heard it distinctly. He got
quickly to his feet and, with soft moccasined tread
he went in the direction of the sound, his pistol in
his hand.</p>

<p>No sooner had the stone fallen than the Captain
motioned the mate to halt. This signal was repeated
to Jack Cales, who was so hidden by the
fog that he could not see the Captain. He stopped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
suddenly so that old Pete tumbled over him, making
some noise.</p>

<p>The Captain almost had a fit of apoplexy because
he did not dare express himself at this interesting
juncture. Jo had heard the noise on the trail and
his suspicions centered in that direction. Noiselessly
he went up with slight footprints in the
damp dust of the trail. The Captain waited his
coming, crouched behind a bend in the trail.</p>

<p>Then Jo saw a huge figure rising suddenly out
of the fog in front of him and, before he could fire,
a great hand gripped for his throat, but if he could
not shoot in defense, at least he could give his comrades
warning. He fired one shot, and then he was
overpowered.</p>

<p>Jim and Juarez heard it instantly. Then Manuello
got in some of his work. Before Juarez
could rise, he struck him a vicious blow upon the
head that stunned him, rendering him unconscious.
Cold with fury, Jim picked up the rat of a Mexican
before he could land a blow upon him, whirled
him over his head and dashed him upon the ground.</p>

<p>Then he sprang through the fog in the direction
of the shot. He heard Jo groan as the ruffians
overpowered him and he leaped up the trail blind
with a fighting rage. The Captain had just got up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
from the struggle with Jo, who lay as good as dead
in the trail.</p>

<p>Then Jim hurled himself upon him. Powerful
though he was, the Captain could not withstand the
sinewy lurch of that sudden attack and together
boy and man crashed from the trail over rocks
and through brush until with a fearful impact they
struck the trunk of a pine tree.</p>

<p>The mate sprang swiftly down to the rescue of
his fallen master. He was a strong, sinewy man
and knew how to act in an emergency.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>"HAUL IN"</h3>


<p>The jar of the fall had knocked out the Captain
partially and Jim had risen to give him the coup
de grace, when he heard the rush of the mate coming
down through the fog. It was a strange sensation
hearing your enemy but not able to see him.</p>

<p>Then the mate plunged into view, a dark ball
through the opaqueness. He could not have
stopped if he had so desired and it was evident that
he did not wish to. For, with lowered head, he
came for Jim as he would for an ugly sailor.</p>

<p>Jim stopped him with his shoulder and ripped in
a right uppercut with his keen hard fist that would
have stopped the heart action of an ordinary man,
and it sent the seasoned mate back upon his
haunches, partially dazed. Feeling the Captain
squirming back to life, he planted a back blow with
his heel in the latter's stomach that took the wind
out of the Captain's sails for the time being. The
mate, a really hardy individual, had made good use<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
of the brief respite and, picking up a heavy stick,
came for Jim with it.</p>

<p>The latter dodged the blow aimed at his head
and it glanced off his shoulder. Then he closed
with the sailor, struggling to put him out. Three
seconds more and Jim would have landed the
proper blow, had not Jack Cales arrived upon the
scene under cover of the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e. Before Jim could
turn to meet this new assailant, a stone crashed
against his head&mdash;and the frontier boys had lost.</p>

<p>The Captain had now recovered sufficiently to
get on his feet, and the fallen Jim was kicked until
the Captain himself called a halt.</p>

<p>"Wait till we get him on board ship, lads," he
said, "and we will finish this job."</p>

<p>"Better get the other two, Cap'n," advised the
mate.</p>

<p>So they dragged the prostrate Jim to the foot of
the trail near where the drinking pool was and went
to look for Juarez and Tom. They saw a small
black object crawling towards them through the
fog.</p>

<p>"What's this a coming?" asked Jack Cales.</p>

<p>"Why, it's my Mexican ferret," said the Captain.
"What's the matter, Manuello?" he asked as he
turned him over none too gently with his foot.</p>

<p>"The big Senor throw me over his head and on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
the ground. I think I crack the world open," he
explained. The Captain roared with laughter.</p>

<p>"Where is the rest of this dangerous gang?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"I will show you," he said, struggling to his feet.
The presence of his master gave him strength and
confidence. "This way, Senor Captain."</p>

<p>He brought them to where Juarez lay upon the
ground, partially held up by Tom, who had been
crying and endeavoring to bring his comrade back
to consciousness from the ugly blow that the Mexican
had given him. I am sure that none could
blame Tom for tears upon this occasion for it was
calculated to try the heart of the stoutest.</p>

<p>"Why, this boy looks like an Indian," said the
Captain regarding Juarez closely.</p>

<p>"He lived with the Indians when a boy, Senor
Captain," volunteered the dwarf, who by subtle
means of his own had become possessed of the
history of the four boys.</p>

<p>"He don't seem to be much more than a boy,
now," said the Captain. They had not paid much
attention to Tom because he seemed a mere kid,
but the hunchback was not to be caught napping,
for he had worked around back of Tom, and as
the latter aimed his revolver at the Captain, having
worked it cautiously out of his holster, the dwarf<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
grabbed him in the nick of time else the expedition
would have lost its head.</p>

<p>Instead of being infuriated as one might have
expected, the Captain was decidedly amused at the
temerity of the youngster, for that is all Tom
appeared to him, and, therefore, he did not hand
him a beating.</p>

<p>"The nerve of the little rooster," guffawed the
Captain. "I'll make a real pirate out of you."</p>

<p>Tom struggled wildly, but it was no use, as
Jack Cales and the mate disarmed him. Just then
there came a loud yell from up the trail.</p>

<p>"Haul in, Cap'n!" It was Old Pete's well known
and melodious voice.</p>

<p>"Jack, go and see what the old cuss wants," ordered
the Captain. "I expect that the lad up there
is trying to kidnap Pete."</p>

<p>When Jack arrived on the scene, he found that
the Skipper had guessed right. For Jo had been
playing possum and was not nearly so badly hurt
as he had appeared to be.</p>

<p>He came near escaping from his keeper and it
was only by a quick forward lunge that Pete had
grabbed him and then occurred a short struggle
in which Pete had called for help and just as Jo
had wrestled himself loose, Cales appeared and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
grabbed him. It took both Pete and Cales quite a
while to subdue him.</p>

<p>Finally it was accomplished and they made him
go down the trail, one on either side. At the foot
of the incline he saw the bruised and battered form
of Jim lying on the ground and a big lump came
into his throat.</p>

<p>"You fellows will pay for this," he said, rendered
desperate by the sight of Jim. But his captors
only laughed, not realizing that the Frontier Boys
were apt to keep their word.</p>

<p>Then they joined the main gang and Jo saw to
his dismay that Tom and Juarez were in the coils
as well as himself and that Juarez, too, had been
laid out and appeared dazed and only partially
conscious of what was going on. Thus there was
little hope of escape with the two leaders, Jim and
Juarez, done for.</p>

<p>"Better search these beggars for their money,
Captain," suggested the mate.</p>

<p>"It hadn't slipped my mind," replied the Skipper.</p>

<p>Now the money and the jewels that the boys
had found in Mexico were in leather belts around
their bodies. These were soon in the possession
of the Captain, but the crew knew full well that
they would receive their share and thus it was that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
the Skipper gave promise of living to a ripe old
age instead of being murdered for his money.</p>

<p>"It's about time to make a start, Cap'n," announced
the mate, and the Captain consulted his
watch by the light of a lantern. He found that
it was half-past eleven.</p>

<p>"We won't be so long going back," he said.
"We will use their horses."</p>

<p>This was easier said than done, for when any of
the crew approached Caliente, that noble animal
became transformed into a tiger and as he came
for them with bared teeth or whirled and kicked
out with his heels, they decided that discretion
was the better part of valor and they left him alone.
Sailors at best are not very clever horsemen.</p>

<p>"Let me have a chance and I'll quiet him for
you," volunteered Jim gruffly. "I don't want to
see you poor fellows eaten alive."</p>

<p>"My lad," said the Skipper solemnly, "I'm no
spring chicken and you can't catch me with any
such chaff."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>MISSOURI'S MAN&#338;UVRE</h3>


<p>The other three horses proved more tractable than
Caliente, and after some skirmishing they managed
to get their new ships rigged up with the saddles
and other tackle. Now as soon as they got their
cargo aboard, they would be prepared to set sail
and to cruise over the plains. (I must use this
nautical language out of respect for Captain
Broom and his crew.)</p>

<p>As I have said before, sailors are poor horsemen
and when it came to making fast the double
cinches, they were quite at sea, where sailors should
be, perhaps. Old Pete came near getting his head
kicked off by pulling the back cinch too tight, but
he and Captain Broom profited by their youthful
experience on a New England farm, so the horses
were finally all saddled and bridled and ready for a
flight&mdash;except Caliente. He was to be left marooned
in the lonely canyon.</p>

<p>It was surprising to Jim and his comrades how
quietly Juarez's roan took matters, but there is no
relying on a broncho, because he always does the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
unexpected, and the Captain was so pleased with
his behavior that he decided to ride the animal
himself.</p>

<p>"Now, that's what I call a well broken hoss,"
he said. "I ain't so sure of the black so I will let
you cruise on him, Jack, being the most active.
I don't know what I shall do for Pete, unless I
can find him a rocking-horse."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with the boys?"
inquired the mate. "Have 'em walk?"</p>

<p>"They can ride their pack mule," said the Captain
grimly.</p>

<p>So Jo, Juarez and Jim were securely fastened
on the patient mule, while Tom rode behind the
mate upon his own horse, but no longer as master.
Then the queer procession started up the trail
through the dense fog. The Captain was in the lead,
followed by the mate with Tom, then the mule with
Pete and the Mexican dwarf guarding the animal
and its cargo, while the active Jack Cales was the
rear guard. It was exactly twelve o'clock when
they weighed anchor and sailed from the harbor
or cove in the mountain canyon.</p>

<p>The three boys said little to each other. They
did not waste their breath with threats of what
they would do to their captors later on, but accepted
the situation with true western stoicism. But you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
may be sure that their minds were active even if
their tongues said little.</p>

<p>They were so securely tied that there was no
chance for them to make a move as their arms
were corded tight to their bodies and their feet
were tied under the belly of the mule. Unless they
had been experienced riders they would have had
a difficult time of it. But it was terribly humiliating,
especially under the insolence of the malignant
Mexican. But he did not dare do them any actual
injury, because the Skipper had given him a warning
which he did not dare to disregard. Finally,
old Pete put an end to his slurring remarks to the
prisoners, so he had to content himself with ugly
looks and frequent expectoration wherewith to
express his disgust.</p>

<p>Before they reached the foot of the trail, Jack
Cales changed with Pete, though the latter demurred
at first, at boarding the strange black craft
with four legs, but finally consented under the urging
of Jack and the warm recommendation of the
boys, who had taken somewhat of a fancy to the
old sailor, since he had shut up the Mexican in
their behalf.</p>

<p>"He won't hurt you, Pop," said Jim, "he is a
good horse. Any lady could ride him."</p>

<p>"I ain't no lady," replied the old fellow suspi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>ciously,
as he slowly and stiffly mounted, while
Jack held his head, that is to say, the horse's
head, not Pete's.</p>

<p>"What did he do that for?" inquired Pete,
anxiously, preparing to dismount.</p>

<p>"Stay on, you old Barnacle," roared the Captain
from the head of the procession, for though he
could not see anything in the rear, still he seemed
able to keep an instinctive tab on his old comrade
Pete.</p>

<p>"That horse is all right, Pop," said Jo, "and I
ought to know. I've ridden him a good many
hundred miles. Don't tickle him with your heels,
that's all."</p>

<p>"I guess that's what I've done," admitted Pete.</p>

<p>Then the procession resumed its march with
Pete as rear guard, riding with due caution and
circumspection as though his craft was loaded with
dynamite and liable to explode at any time. Jack
Cales tried to quiz the prisoners on the mule in a
friendly way, but they would not relax in their
attitude of grim, if not sullen, defiance towards
their captors.</p>

<p>Captain Broom need not think that his prisoners
would ever accept any conditions from him.
Doubtless, he thought that these boys might be
trained to help him in his business for he appre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>ciated
their courage and fighting ability, but he did
not fully understand what stuff the frontier boys
were made of.</p>

<p>The procession of pirates and their prisoners had
now reached the foot of the range and were in close
proximity to the ranch, but everything favored the
plans of the Skipper of the Sea Eagle. The fog
became denser when they reached the level plain
so that it was scarcely possible for the rider to see
the ears of his horse.</p>

<p>Every sound was deadened, so that they could
have gone directly past the ranch houses and not
even the dogs would have heard them. But the
Captain was determined to take no chances, and
as soon as the party were free of the canyon, he
bore off toward the south, making quite a circuit.</p>

<p>Anybody but an experienced navigator would
have been lost in the fog upon the plain, but you
could not lose Captain Broom either on the high
seas or the low plains. They passed between two
wooded hills, which the reader will have to take
on faith as he cannot see them. Then across a
gully, on the other side of which they came to a
barb wire fence.</p>

<p>This did not stop them long, as the Captain cut
it and they rode through. From the footing which
was about all that could be observed, they appeared<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
to be in a pasture land with a gentle slope towards
the sea. The fog did not diminish in thickness and
the boys determined to escape. Here was their
chance, if they could be said to have one.</p>

<p>"Here's where we make a break," said Jim to
Juarez. "Guide the mule alongside of Tom. Then
we will run for it." Jim did not say this in so many
words, but he had ways and means of indicating to
Juarez, who was tied directly back of him, by a sign
and poke language which Juarez was quick to seize.</p>

<p>It seemed at every turn that his experience with
the Indians was a help to him. The mule was a
prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Juarez and with a word he could guide
it in any direction that he wished it to go. The
fog was one thing that favored them. The Mexican
could scarcely be seen and Jack Cales stalked
along looking like a giant through the mist.</p>

<p>He had grown somewhat lax through the long
march. This was the time, if ever. Jim gave
Juarez the signal that all was ready. A quick word
to the mule and he trotted out from his place in
the column, knocking over the Mexican and before
Cales was fairly awake to the situation, he was
obscured by the fog.</p>

<p>In about two seconds he had hove alongside of
the horse that the mate was on. Tom was foot-loose,
and no sooner did he see Missouri's long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
ears through the fog, than he was ready for action.</p>

<p>"Jump, Tom," urged Jim. It took only about
two seconds for Tom to execute the man&#339;uvre.</p>

<p>"Halt!" roared the Captain, and he tried to turn
the roan to capture the runaways, but right here,
the broncho strain in the animal showed itself.</p>

<p>He began to buck and never in all his experience
had the redoubtable Captain Broom ever been on
so choppy a sea. It was hard to distinguish fog
from whiskers. At the second hunch upward, the
Captain shot into space. The boys did not tarry to
watch for his descent. A word from Juarez to the
mule, and Missouri turned directly south just as
Jack Cales came rushing up.</p>

<p>"Touch him with your foot, Tom," said Juarez,
meaning the mule, not Cales. Tom's heel reached
the right spot and up flew the mule's hind feet with
the rapidity of a rapid fire-gun.</p>

<p>One foot struck Cales on the shoulder with a
sufficient impact to send him down and out. The
mate had been involved in the cyclone of which
Captain Broom was the centre. Tom's horse, considered
the gentlest of the four, had become infected
with the roan's example and he started in
to do a little bucking on his own account. Never
since the mate had rounded Cape Horn, had he
known so much action in so short a time.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>The only one left was Old Pete and he came on
right gallantly, but by dodging and turning they
got away in the fog. After putting what they considered
a safe distance between themselves and
their former captors, Juarez persuaded Missouri
to halt, and Tom went to work and with great
difficulty first untied, then lifted, them to the
ground for the boys were as stiff as boards from
being tied hard and fast for so long a time.</p>

<p>"My, but it certainly hurts," said Jo, stamping
around in an endeavor to get the blood to circulating
again. "It's just like it used to be back home
in the winter when we would go skating and get
our hands numb."</p>

<p>"What is the matter, Juarez?" asked Jim in
alarm.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm all right, I guess," he said in a voice
that sounded faint to the boys and far away to himself.
Then, without warning, he fell over on the
ground and stiffened out.</p>

<p>"It's from the blow that the greaser gave him,"
said Tom. "It would have killed him if it had
struck him fair."</p>

<p>"Wait until I get my hands on him," cried Jim,
significantly.</p>

<p>What should they do now? It was not an easy
question to decide.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>THE RANCHERO</h3>


<p>They could not desert Juarez and they could not
get far with him. It was enough to stagger them
and it seemed that they had reached the end of their
resources.</p>

<p>"If it wasn't such an open country," said Jo,
"we might hide until they had got out of range and
then get to the nearest ranch."</p>

<p>"If they overtake us we can stand them off,"
saying this Jim reached for his revolver. To his
astonishment it was gone. Then he remembered
he had been disarmed by Captain Broom, and they
were absolutely defenseless unless they could depend
on Missouri's heels which had furnished them
such active protection.</p>

<p>Finally they brought Juarez around so that he
was able to sit up.</p>

<p>"Where am I?" he asked in a sort of daze.</p>

<p>"You will be all right in a minute, old chap," encouraged
Jim, speaking cheerfully, but he did not
feel so.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>"You bet I will," he assented feebly, but with
invincible determination. "What are you holding
me for, Jim? Let's get at those fellows." It was
evident that his mind was not exactly clear yet.
They got him on his feet and he seemed better,
though still very wabbly.</p>

<p>"There come those fellows," cried Jim, suddenly,
with more of despair in his tone than he had
ever spoken before, no matter how hard pressed
they had been. But before there had always been
something to do, but now they were helpless. Jim
looked hastily around for some weapon. All he
found was a small round stone.</p>

<p>With a yell of exultation, Jack Cales and the
mate dashed down upon them, followed by the Captain
and old Pete. They had been able to follow
the distinctive mark of the mule's shoes in the soft
earth until they came in hearing of the boys' voices.
Then they jumped upon them. They were out for
blood this time, for they had the boys' revolvers in
their hands, probably because they were better than
their own.</p>

<p>Missouri, finding himself free, made off. Tom
halted when covered by one of the sailor's revolvers,
but Jim dodged as the mate fired at him. The
lug of lead spattered the mud between his feet, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
next second he was off full speed through the fog,
followed by fleet Jo.</p>

<p>The sailors soon gave up the useless chase, for
there was no trail to guide them, so they had to
content themselves with half of their original capture
and they started for the cove where the Sea
Eagle was anchored as fast as they could go,
though they were hampered by Juarez.</p>

<p>"Better leave him, Captain," urged old Pete.
"He is nothing but a nuisance."</p>

<p>"I'll have use for that fellow yet," said the Captain.
"As for the other lad, he won't feel so lively
after a few days on shipboard."</p>

<p>This did not have a very cheerful sound for Tom
and he was in anything but a happy frame of mind.
Still he had great confidence in Jim and did not
give up hope of being rescued before the coast was
reached. It was now getting towards daybreak,
and the fog began to lift somewhat so that they
could see a distance of thirty or forty yards.</p>

<p>Captain Broom's gang had now left the region
of the level pasture and were coming to the brush
section, fringing the coast, and beyond that they
reached the sand dunes. The nearer they came to
the sea the more depressed Tom became. The only
thing that encouraged him was the fact that Juarez
began to seem like himself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us now return to Jo and Jim, who had been
so fortunate as to make their escape. As soon as
they were sure that the pursuit was at an end, they
slowed down to a walk.</p>

<p>"Well, they didn't give us much of a chase,"
remarked Jim.</p>

<p>"Plenty to suit me. What are we going to do
now?"</p>

<p>"This fog is beginning to lift," said Jim, "and
then we can take our bearings. I want to locate
this ranch the first thing, and then we can get
help."</p>

<p>"Here's a wire fence," announced Jo, "I reckon
it's the one the old geser cut."</p>

<p>"It surely is and a straight course north is our
direction," remarked Jim.</p>

<p>"Here are hills that look like those we rode
through," said Jo.</p>

<p>"We will soon be there now," was Jim's cheerful
comment "What's that? It sounds like a dog
barking." They stopped, listening intently, as the
sound came faint, but there was no mistaking it.</p>

<p>"I suppose it's some big hound, that they usually
keep on these ranches," said Jo, who was beginning
to feel depressed from hunger and fatigue, "and
he will jump at us because we haven't any
weapons."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>But in spite of Jo's fear they hurried on in the
direction of the sound. In a short time, they came
to a road between two barb wire fences, which the
reader will remember that the Captain and his crew
took when they were coming through the Sebastian
ranch. But the boys struck it higher up, and were
soon in the pasture that sloped down from the ranch
houses toward the road.</p>

<p>Jim and Jo now heard the voices of men as well
as the baying of the dogs. The men were talking
excitedly about the finding of one of their number
in the canyon tied and gagged, and it was evident
that it was not a good time for strangers to
visit the ranch of the Sebastians.</p>

<p>But Jim and Jo were dulled to danger and did
not care what risk they ran and so they called to the
men in a friendly Spanish greeting. There was
instantly a great hubbub, and two men charged
down upon them, preceded by a couple of fierce-looking
mongrels. These came dashing for them
with red, gaping mouths. The boys defended
themselves gallantly with two stout sticks that they
had picked up. Then the two Mexicans took a
hand.</p>

<p>"Look out, Jo," cried Jim, who was ever on the
alert. "That fellow is going to throw his lasso."
Jo dodged just in the nick of time, but this gave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
one of the dogs a chance, and if Jim had not
stunned him by a resounding crack on the head it
would have gone hard with his brother.</p>

<p>Just then another man appeared on the scene, attracted
from the vicinity of the house by the noise
of the encounter. He came full speed on a splendid
sorrel. It was Juan Sebastian, a dark, handsome
young man, a true son of Spain.</p>

<p>"What's all this?" he cried as he rode up. "Here,
Sancho, Jan, you brutes, come off." The dogs
slunk obediently to heel.</p>

<p>"We found those insolent Gringoes," said one of
the men, "coming straight for the Senor's house.
We undertook to stop them."</p>

<p>"Senor," said Jim, bowing low and speaking in
his best Spanish, "we are sorry, my brother and I,
to have caused this disturbance. We are strangers
and unfortunate, and we have heard of your
hospitality, Senor"&mdash;Jim bowed again. He was
not so simple, after all.</p>

<p>The Senor Sebastian returned the bow with
more grace than Jim could command.</p>

<p>"I regret, Senor&mdash;" he hesitated.</p>

<p>"Darlington," added Jim.</p>

<p>"Senor Darlington, that you have been attacked
in this manner, but there has been a party
of desperadoes that have been overrunning this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
part of the country for the past two days, and
they took one of my men and bound and gagged
him and so you see, Senors," a smile and bow
completed the Spanish gentleman's apology perfectly.</p>

<p>"We have just escaped, not more than an hour
ago, from these same desperadoes," said Jim.
"They have taken my brother and friend with
them towards the coast."</p>

<p>"We will saddle and overtake them," promised
the Senor, "after we have had breakfast."</p>

<p>Jim was stunned by this gentle sort of procrastination.</p>

<p>"But, Senor," he said gravely, "we will not be
able to overtake them if we do not start immediately.
Pardon my abruptness, but I cannot rest
while there are two of my party prisoners in the
hands of this gang of cut-throats."</p>

<p>"It is to be perfectly understood," replied the
Spaniard with no less gravity, "we will make
haste, but first we will eat while the servants are
getting two of the horses ready for you and your
brother."</p>

<p>This was not Jim's idea of making haste by a
long shot, but he was enough of a traveler to
recognize that the ways of men and nations differed
and that nothing was to be gained by going<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
against the grain of a national characteristic. So
while fuming inwardly, he was outwardly quiet
and composed. He argued, too, that it was not
likely the pirate gang would retain the captured
prisoners. Later, when they were themselves at
a safe distance they would set free the others.</p>

<p>As they went towards the house, the Spaniard
dismounted and walked with them, giving his
horse into the charge of one of the men, with directions
to bring two other horses to the house.
There was an unmistakable courtesy in doing this
and the boys appreciated it. They could not help
but contrast their appearance with that of the
Spaniard. He was not gaudily dressed like a
vaquero, but everything he wore was possessed
of a certain richness and was not lacking in color.
He truly was a Prince of the South in appearance
as well as in courtesy.</p>

<p>Jim and Jo were disreputable beyond words.
Their clothes were muddy, torn and disheveled,
their faces so grimed that it was hard to tell their
original color, and there were blotches of blood
upon their clothes as well as faces and hands.
But, though they looked worse than tramps, there
was something straightforward in their manner
and their way of speech that the Spaniard was
quick to recognize.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>As they walked along the Spaniard explained
that his household had been unusually disturbed
that morning. His mother, he said, was an invalid,
and had escaped from her attendant. Some
mental trouble, he briefly mentioned as the cause
of the elderly lady's worriment. Evidently, he did
not connect the tragedy in his own life, in which
his father's life was sacrificed, with the boys' antagonist.
His mother, he assured them, had been
found and was returned to her home.</p>

<p>The boys now had a good view of the house,
as they approached it. The fog having lifted,
they could take in the whole situation. The structure
itself was of adobe, of the early California
type, low, with broad verandas, and built on four
sides around a court with a fountain in the centre,
with fish in the basin, and grass around it.
There were beautiful rose-tree bushes with gold
and red clusters growing over the corners of the
house.</p>

<p>From the verandah there was a beautiful view
looking off over the surrounding country. The
house itself stood on a rise of ground that sloped
gently from the plain below. Back of it rose the
mountains of the coast range, while in the distance
glittered the broad breadths of the Pacific, shining<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
like an azure floor. As far as eye could see was
the domain of this great ranch. It was, indeed, a
princely estate, and one of which the Senor Sebastian
might well be proud. Those were the days
of romance and of charm in the land of Southern
California.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>A NEW FRIEND</h3>


<p>The servants eyed the two boys curiously as
they stepped upon the verandah and the brothers
were not reassured by any looks of friendliness,
though they were outwardly courteous. A withered
looking old woman, who looked to Jim as
though she had Indian blood showed the boys to
a room, where they could wash up.</p>

<p>"Jove! Doesn't it dazzle your eyes, Jo?" exclaimed
Jim, "to see a real room, with a bed and
a white spread, with those starched things where
the pillows ought to be."</p>

<p>"This room would certainly please Aunt
Maria," remarked Jo. "That four poster bed
with the canopy over it, is an old timer, I'll warrant
you."</p>

<p>"If I slept in this room," said Jim, "I would
make a low bow to the bed and then roll up in my
blanket and go to sleep on the floor."</p>

<p>"How do I look?" asked Jo, after he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
rubbed and scrubbed his face for a long time.</p>

<p>"You have got off the first layer," replied Jim,
"and look about the color of a half-breed. Let
me try my hand at polishing up."</p>

<p>"It will take you a week," remarked Jo discouragingly.</p>

<p>It cannot be truly said that they looked ornamental
even when they were clean, for Jim's face
was badly torn, one side of it being scraped raw.
He got this memento when he tackled the Captain
and fell down into the canyon with him. One
eye was blackened and the other cheek bruised.
These disadvantages were not to be overcome in
a short time.</p>

<p>Jo was somewhat more presentable, but he, too,
showed signs of the rough time that they had had
with the Captain and his "merry" crew. But in
spite of all this, there was something in their bearing,
an honest hardihood and manliness that could
not be discounted by torn clothes and bruised
faces.</p>

<p>"This room looks dirty, now," said Jo, "I'm
ashamed to leave it like this."</p>

<p>"We will go outside to brush off our clothes,"
proposed Jim, "and I'm going to empty this dirty
water myself." He started out with it when he
met one of the servants in the hall. With many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
explanations, numerous gestures and much excitement,
she took the pail from Jim and disappeared
with it.</p>

<p>"They won't let you do anything for yourself
here, Jo," reported Jim, returning to the room.</p>

<p>This was correct and the boys noticed afterwards
that the servants regarded them with odd
expressions of amusement and it was evident to
the sensitive Jo that they were being "guyed" by
them, to use a modern expression. The boys
being American lads, were self-reliant, and were
accustomed to do everything for themselves, and,
unknowingly they had gone counter to a custom
of constant service of the Spaniards. It was to
demean oneself, according to their code, to do any
menial work.</p>

<p>"Might as well start for the dining room," proposed
Jo. "I hate leaving Tom and Juarez to
their fate this way."</p>

<p>"I more than hate it," protested Jim, "but as
you can't hurry these people, we will make the
best time by falling in with their way of doing
business."</p>

<p>Then they went out into a passageway and, taking
the wrong turn, which was quite easy in the
rambling old house, they came to a door that entered
into the courtyard.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>"My, but this is beautiful," exclaimed Jo. "It
makes you appreciate California better when you
see a place like this."</p>

<p>"That hammock looks good to me," said Jim.
"I would like to stretch out in it right now."</p>

<p>Just then the door opened on the verandah and a
really beautiful young girl stepped out. She was
probably seventeen years of age, dressed in white,
with a black mantilla over her equally black hair
and her dark cheeks glowed with color. A very
romantic meeting, Messieurs, the gallant young
Americans at one end of the verandah and the
Senorita at the other. Then she saw Jim and
Jo with their scarred and bruised faces. With a
little shriek, and clasping her hand to her eyes,
she retreated quickly to her room.</p>

<p>"What did you do to scare that girl, Jo?" inquired
Jim severely of his brother.</p>

<p>"Nothing," declared Jo, stoutly. "It was the
sight of your face. It would give a wooden Injun
a chill." Jim felt of the said face reflectively.</p>

<p>"I guess you are right, Jo," he admitted, "but
you ain't so charming in appearance that you
would do any damage."</p>

<p>"Let's walk along this side," proposed Jo.
"Perhaps we will locate the breakfast."</p>

<p>"All right," agreed Jim.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>So they stalked along, more or less conscious
that a pair of dark blue eyes were regarding them,
and they thought they heard a trill of
laughter, but it might have been one of the maids.
They need not have felt embarrassed for there
was the grace in their movements that goes with
strength and youth and suppleness.</p>

<p>They were walking under a perfect bower of
flowers anyway. For this side was beautifully latticed
and over the lattice work grew vines with
purple and golden flowers, that would give a
grateful shade when the California sun would
drive the fog away.</p>

<p>Under foot there was a double flagging of
stone with trodden dirt on either side.</p>

<p>"I don't see a broom anywhere," said Jo.</p>

<p>Just then they heard the voice of Senor Sebastian
behind them and they turned quickly.</p>

<p>"I had begun to fear, Senors, that you had become
lost again."</p>

<p>"We were, partially, Senor."</p>

<p>"Our simple breakfast is ready now if you are,"
he said.</p>

<p>"We will have to brush the dirt off before we
can go in," protested Jim.</p>

<p>"Antonio bring a brush," called the Senor. In
a moment a gray-haired, bent Mexican came with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
a big kitchen broom. Instantly the Senor flushed
with anger.</p>

<p>"Stupid one, my guests are not my horses.
Have a care."</p>

<p>A suspicion flashed through Jim's mind that
the ancient servitor had brought the broom on
purpose. It was clear that the servants did not
have a very high opinion of their American visitors.
The next time he returned he had gotten
the right brush, and made a point of sneezing as
the dust flew from their mud-dried clothes. This
made Jim laugh in spite of himself.</p>

<p>"More dust than the Sirocco brings," said Jim.
The old servitor regarded him with a cunning eye.</p>

<p>"Si, Senor," he said, then he was seized with a
perfect convulsion of sneezing. This aroused his
master's ire.</p>

<p>"No more of that, Antonio," he commanded,
"or it will be the lash." Antonio's cold was cured
from that moment. Jim's mouth twitched at the
corners with the humor of it but he did not laugh
now for that would be discourteous to his host.</p>

<p>Finally the brushing was finished to the regret
of the servants, who had kept an amused eye on
Antonio's performance, while pretending to be
busy on some trivial tasks near the Patio or
court. In her own room, the Senorita was faint<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
with laughter as she watched Antonio dusting the
two American lads.</p>

<p>It was a simple breakfast that the boys found
prepared for them in a long, low dining-room,
with its dark beams and white plastered walls.
The coffee was excellent, with a delicate aroma,
and was probably the best that Mexico could
afford. There was a large plate of meat garnished
with peppers, and a mixed dish of vegetables
that looked odd, but that tasted deliciously.
You may be sure that Jim and Jo appreciated their
meal, and they felt invigorated when it was finished,
wishing all the while, however, that they
were on the trail of their captured comrades.</p>

<p>"Now, Senors, the horses are at the door. They
are spirited, but I am sure that you ride well."</p>

<p>This was a mere expression of courtesy on his
part, for he did not expect any such thing and
thought to see his guests fall off if the horses
should rise on their hind legs, as they no doubt
would, for there was not a horse on the big rancho
but what was peppery and spirited. No sooner
had the Senor spoke than Jim jumped to his feet,
putting his hand to his head.</p>

<p>"I have forgotten about Caliente!" he exclaimed.
"It is my horse, Senor," he explained to his host.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
"He is up the canyon because the gang that attacked
us last night were afraid of him."</p>

<p>"I will send for him," said the Senor.</p>

<p>"By the pool in the pocket," said Jim. "But I
think I ought to get him myself, though I appreciate
your offer, but one's horse, you know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I understand perfectly."</p>

<p>"I cannot leave him without food and water,"
said Jim.</p>

<p>"I will attend to that. I will send a trustworthy
man," and he spoke to the servant who was waiting
on the table. In a short time he returned
with a tall, sinewy man, with straight black hair
and dark skin. He gave this man the necessary
instructions and with a "Si, Senor," the man went
out.</p>

<p>"A good reliable fellow," remarked Jim. "He
looks like an Indian."</p>

<p>"He is an Indian," replied their host, "but of
the right kind. Your horse is in good hands."</p>

<p>"Tell him to bring him down to the ranch," said
Jim. "I'll trust Caliente with him." The Indian
was called back and under his stolid demeanor
was an appreciation of Jim's confidence.</p>

<p>Breakfast over they went out on the verandah,
where they could see the horses. They were spirited
looking beasts all right. One was a bay, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
two front legs white stockinged, very trimly built,
with a flashing eye, that he kept rolling around.
The boy who was holding him had his hands full,
as the bay would rise on his hind legs and strike
out viciously with his forefeet.</p>

<p>The other animal was much heavier than the
bay. A brilliant black, whose coat fairly shone
with careful grooming. He had been standing
comparatively quiet until the three appeared upon
the verandah of the house, then, with a sudden
surge backward, he dragged the Mexican boy off
his feet, shaking his head viciously.</p>

<p>"We ought to be armed, Senor," advised Jim.
"If we should overtake those men, they will put
up a desperate fight."</p>

<p>"Certainly, Senor," he answered. "Come into
this room and select your weapon."</p>

<p>After both Jim and Jo were armed, they went
out to the horses.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>THE PURSUIT</h3>


<p>All the servants seemed just now to find duties
of importance in front of the house or near it.
They had no idea of missing the chance of seeing
these Gringoes, whom they held in contempt,
thrown from their horses.</p>

<p>Jim took the black and Jo was left the red, the
easiest to manage even if he seemed the liveliest.
Jo was too quick for his horse and before he
could whirl to one side, he was in the saddle.
Then his animal reared and plunged but Jo sat
on him as easily as a cowboy does his steed. There
was no mistaking his horsemanship. The servants
were duly and deeply disappointed.</p>

<p>But their hopes revived when they saw Jim
tackle the black. He began that steady sideways
movement which Jim knew so well, whenever he
tried to put his foot in the stirrup. The servants
began to smile, here would be some fun. The
"Black Devil," as they called the horse, had been
known to kill men, so they had pleasant anticipa<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>tions.
When Jim found that he could not mount
by the stirrup, he made a quick, powerful leap
and was in the saddle.</p>

<p>"Bravo!" cried the Senor Sebastian, but he
knew that the fight had just begun.</p>

<p>Jo looked on with interest and perfect confidence
in brother Jim's ability. The black stood
perfectly stunned for a moment or two at being
so suddenly mounted, then he sprang into action.
With his back in a hump he shot into the air and
came down stiff-legged.</p>

<p>Without loss of a second he went into the air
again, higher than before. From the corral the
Mexican cowboys were looking at the duel between
the horse and the boy with lively interest.</p>

<p>"The Diablo will kill him," said one nonchalantly,
blowing a puff of smoke from his cigarette.</p>

<p>"Five dollars that the Gringo stays on," said a
second. The wager was made and others followed,
for the Mexicans are inveterate gamblers.
The third time the horse pitched into the air,
Jim swaying with the animal's every motion as the
trained cowboy does. Finding that he could not
dislodge his rider that way, the black rose on his
hind legs to a perpendicular position.</p>

<p>Jim knew the trick of old, and was prepared for
it. As the horse started to fall backwards, Jim<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
who had been sticking like a leech, leaped lightly
to the ground and with all his strength, pulling
upon the bridle, slammed him to the ground. No
sooner was the horse upon his feet again than Jim
was in the saddle.</p>

<p>Once more he tried that falling back trick and
this time Jim brought him down upon the damp
earth with a thud that jarred things. The black
devil had had enough. He stood quivering and
sweating, but for the time being subdued.</p>

<p>"Bravo!" cried the Senor Sebastian again, and
he shook his guest by the hand warmly. "You
are a true horseman. Now we shall go. We
shall eat up the miles."</p>

<p>The crowd of cowboys swung their hats in a
salute to the Gringo, who could conquer the black
devil, while the house servants, disappointed at
the stranger's triumph, went back to their different
tasks.</p>

<p>The three horsemen galloped away down the
sloping pasture, the Spaniard in advance as he
knew the country and the most direct way to the
coast. His horse was a splendid sorrel, somewhat
taller than the horse that Jim rode. And he was
a gallant figure in his leather riding suit and
peaked sombrero with a brilliant colored band
around it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>Jim and Jo rode few yards behind the Spaniard
and side by side. Jim felt a certain exultation
in his victory over the Black before people
who would have liked to have seen him defeated.
It was exhilarating, too, this plunging gallop
ahead with a chance to rescue Tom and Juarez
and to get even with Captain Broom and his gang,
who had taken away their valuables and had given
the boys such a cruel defeat.</p>

<p>"This is a fine horse," said Jim, "though he
hasn't the stride of Caliente."</p>

<p>"He is a beauty, when it comes to bucking,"
Jo commented. "There is nothing the matter
with this bay but my black can beat him for
speed."</p>

<p>So they flew on, the speed of their steeds blowing
back their horses' manes, and the fresh air from
the sea bringing a feeling of hope to their
hearts, that they would yet be able to overtake
the pirates, and rescue their comrades in distress.
Their horses' feet were devouring the
miles.</p>

<p>"We stand a chance to get 'em at this rate,"
shouted Jim.</p>

<p>"Won't it be fine if we can all sit down to
dinner tonight?" replied Jo. "I bet that Tom and
Juarez would enjoy a square meal with the Senor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
at the ranch house. Ifs kind of nice to be civilized
once in a while."</p>

<p>"You're right, it is," declared Jim emphatically.</p>

<p>"I wonder if there isn't a store around here
where we could buy some clothes," inquired Jo,
anxiously. "We look too disreputable to appear
in polite society."</p>

<p>"Thinking about that girl, I suppose?" remarked
Jim with brotherly intuition.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't be so sure if I were you," replied
Jo evasively. "How about the Senorita down
in Mexico who threw you the rose at the castle?"
This reference to the Senorita Cordova whom
the Frontier Boys had rescued in Mexico, checked
Jim from getting too gay for he still had a tender
place in his memory for her.</p>

<p>The fog by this time was entirely dissipated,
and they could see by certain white or rather light
spots in the clouds where the sun was going to
break through and an absolutely clear day would
result. The three riders had now reached the
brush region that began a few miles from the
coast and they were compelled to go more
slowly.</p>

<p>But if they had only known what was going on
not more than two miles away from where they
were, they would not have slackened speed no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
matter what risk they ran. For Captain Broom
and his crew with the two captives had arrived at
the cove and old Pete and Jack Cales were going
into the cave for the boat.</p>

<p>There was a chance, but the Senor and his companions
must hurry. Some mishap to the pirates'
expedition just at this point and the frontier boys
would win. Tom and Juarez might have sung the
tune that they had often sung before in camp.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Tramp, tramp, tramp, the boys are marching,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Cheer up, comrades, they will come,</span><br />
And beneath the starry flag<br />
We will breathe the air again<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of freedom in our own beloved home."</span><br />
</div>

<p>But they did not know and they sat miserable
and dejected upon the damp sand of the beach,
not knowing that Jim and Jo were coming nearer
every second. Then there came an accident,
though a slight one, that gave the pursuers a
chance.</p>

<p>Old Pete was carrying one end of the boat. He
was nervous, anyway, in regard to the cave and
its grewsome contents, thought he saw some dark
spectre coming for him out of the blackness of the
cave and he dropped his end of the boat and
scudded for the beach.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>The Captain was furious, giving him a blow
that sent him spinning half way down to the
water, and he and the mate rushed back to see
what damage the boat had suffered. It was only
slightly stove in, but every second was precious.
The pursuers were only a mile away.</p>

<p>Jim began to grow restless as they neared the
coast. He seemed to feel that they were nearing
the enemy, and at his urging, the Spaniard, who
had an increased respect and liking for Jim ever
since he had conquered Black Diablo, put his horse
to the gallop, and away they went along the narrow
winding path through the bushes.</p>

<p>The branches whipt them, but they paid no attention,
but on they went; it was evident that they
made considerable racket and Captain Broom,
with a fierce burst of energy for which he was
famous, got the boat launched, the two prisoners
in, and with himself and the mate at the oars,
made the boat leap forward over the lazy rolling
swell towards the graceful Sea Eagle.</p>

<p>When they had reached a point half-way to the
vessel, the horsemen came tearing through the
last screen of brush onto the yellow sand. The
enemy had escaped by the skin of its teeth and it
was heart-rending to see Tom and Juarez being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
carried away from them at every stroke of the
oars towards their black prison. Jim put up his
hands to his mouth and yelled:</p>

<p>"We will rescue you, boys. Don't give up.
We'll get 'em yet."</p>

<p>A derisive yell greeted this challenge and one of
the men in the boat fired at the group on the
shore, but the bullet fell harmlessly short. They
did not dare to fire in return lest they hit either
Tom or Juarez.</p>

<p>"They have steam up on board," observed Jim.
"But I see one chance to do some execution."</p>

<p>It was this. The Sea Eagle was anchored close
under a cliff on the northern side of the cove. So
Jim slipped off his horse, for the way on that side
was impracticable except on foot. It was hard
going at that, especially as there were a good
many cacti with their wretched thorns.</p>

<p>Jim stepped gingerly along over the rocks, gliding
through the bushes until at last he reached
a point above the vessel where he could almost
look down upon her decks. The boat from the
shore had just come alongside and the prisoners
were hustled into the cabin and the door locked.
Tom and Juarez were a dejected-looking pair and
it made Jim's heart ache to see them.</p>

<p>The Captain went upon the quarter-deck and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
gave an order to the man at the wheel. The
anchor had already been weighed. Slowly and
gracefully the Sea Eagle turned, and there stood
Captain Broom, as big as life upon the bridge.
Why did not Jim fire? Because he had come to
a certain wise conclusion.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>JIM AND THE SEA EAGLE</h3>


<p>As Jim had raised his revolver to fire, a sudden
idea came to him. In the first place he rebelled
instinctively from shooting a man down in cold
blood from ambush, even if he was as desperate
and crime-stained a character as Captain Bill
Broom, besides it would not save Tom and Juarez
and only make their captivity harder to endure,
if any injury was done the Captain.</p>

<p>Another thing, Jim was sure that if he began
the attack that his two comrades would be used
as shields to protect the man at the wheel, so that
the Sea Eagle could be navigated safely out of the
cove. He saw with interest the narrow place between
two lines of foam above hidden ledges
where the boat must pass in order to reach the
open sea. He marvelled at the temerity of Captain
Broom in daring to bring his ship through
such a place.</p>

<p>Then a brilliant thought came to him, a sudden
stroke that might turn defeat into victory. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
Sea Eagle was now making straight for the narrow
channel. Jim slipped back for a short distance
an ran as rapidly as he could to a point
a little to the west of where he had first hidden.
He did not have long to wait. The Sea Eagle
was almost directly opposite his place of ambush,
and was just sticking her nose into the narrow
passage.</p>

<p>Jim raised his revolver and took careful aim
and fired. The man at the wheel gave a yell and
clapped his hand to the shoulder, letting go the
wheel and the nose of the little steamer swung
toward the rock. A swell lifted her bow clear
by a few inches, and the Captain caught the
steamer by the wheel and brought her to a course.</p>

<p>"Bring those boys up on deck and shoot them
if that black-haired devil," (meaning Jim) "fires
another shot," he called to the mate.</p>

<p>That worthy was not slow to obey the order,
he had them on deck in full sight in a jiffy and
held a pistol at Tom's head. Jim had raised his
arm to fire at the Captain when he heard his order
and it was as if he had been paralyzed. He knew
that Tom and Juarez would have been killed to a
certainty if he fired another shot.</p>

<p>Luck had broken against him again, for that
was all that had kept the Sea Eagle from going on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
the reef, where if she had not been wrecked, she
and her crew would have been at the mercy of the
men on shore. Just the lifting of the wave had
saved the vessel by a few inches, that, and Captain
Broom's quick and skillful action.</p>

<p>The second round of the contest had gone in
favor of the pirate and his crew, but only by a
shade as it were. But it would not surprise me a
bit if Jim evened up matters in the third and final
round. Let us hope so, at least, for that will give
a silver lining to the black cloud that had rolled
over the boys' fortunes at this particular time.</p>

<p>Jim made his way slowly back to where Jo and
the Senor were waiting for him on the beach. He
was despondent over the failure of his plans by so
close a margin, and the sight of Tom and Juarez
helpless on the deck in the hands of these sea-coast
pirates, was always before his eyes.</p>

<p>"What were you trying to do, Jim?" inquired
Jo, "Sink the ship?" Before Jim could reply, the
Spaniard gave a cry of warning.</p>

<p>"Look out, they are going to shoot."</p>

<p>Glancing toward the Sea Eagle, which was now
a half mile from shore, they saw a puff of smoke,
and then a shell struck into the beach below them
and exploding, sent a shower of sand over them
and the horses. The latter, frightened, reared and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
plunged, but the boys soon got their animals under
control, as they quickly tired of acting up in the
heavy sand. Jim shook his fist in the direction of
the Sea Eagle.</p>

<p>"Curse your insolence!" he yelled. "I'll make
every one of you eat crow, you miserable
hounds!"</p>

<p>Jim looked ugly, his eyes glared with concentrated
fury and the veins on his temple were swollen
and throbbing. Unthinkingly, he pulled back
hard upon the bit, sending his horse up in the air.</p>

<p>"Easy, boy," he said, soothingly. "Easy. It
was my fault for yanking you."</p>

<p>When the horse was quieted, Jim was cooled
down to his normal temperature, and he told his
comrades of his attack upon the Sea Eagle and
how it had turned out.</p>

<p>"Senor Darlington," said the Spaniard impressively,
"I will take off my hat to you. You are a
natural General. Take my advice, my friend,
and go to Spain. There you might head a revolution
and in time rise to high mark."</p>

<p>"I appreciate your praise deeply, Senor Sebastian,"
responded Jim, "but my own country,
Senor, I could not leave it for another."</p>

<p>"Right, Senor," replied the Spaniard, "you have
the true spirit."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>"Which way will she turn, do you suppose?"
asked Jo, pointing to the vessel that was moving
steadily out on the Pacific in a straight line from
the shore.</p>

<p>"To the North, doubtless," replied the Spaniard.</p>

<p>"Wherever she goes we must find her out,"
said Jim, with grim determination.</p>

<p>"I wish we could follow them," sighed Jo. "If
we could only hire a boat."</p>

<p>"They have our money," replied Jim, briefly.</p>

<p>"I had forgotten that," said Jo, and his face
showed his disappointment.</p>

<p>"Permit me to help you," said the Spaniard, "I
am to blame for detaining you at breakfast."</p>

<p>"That is generous of you, Senor," replied Jim,
"but I do not favor going to the expense of chartering
a steamer. Even if it were possible, my
plan would be to follow along the coast on horseback
and see what can be done when they make a
landing."</p>

<p>"As you are the General," replied the Spaniard,
"we will allow you to make the plans."</p>

<p>"Look!" exclaimed Jo, "they are turning South
instead of North."</p>

<p>"Impossible!" cried the Spaniard. "There is
only one port within two hundred miles. I do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
not understand. Yes, they are surely going
South."</p>

<p>"Perhaps they have a secret landing place,"
hazarded Jim.</p>

<p>"Not so," replied the Spaniard. "Not a harbor
where they could land save one and there they
would not dare to go."</p>

<p>The three watchers on horseback gazed until
there was little to be seen other than a smudge of
smoke upon the horizon. It was no use, the Sea
Eagle was holding to her southerly course to some
mysterious port. The sun had now come out and
was shining with sheer brilliance upon the sparkling
ocean.</p>

<p>"We must return now," said the Spaniard.
"There is nothing more for us to do at present."</p>

<p>"I think that my brother and I will start this
afternoon and take the trail to the south," announced
Jim, "wherever those fellows set foot, I
want to be waiting for them."</p>

<p>"I fear it is impossible to start so soon," replied
the Spaniard, "I must go with you as I know the
country to the South, every foot of it."</p>

<p>"The Senor is right, Jim," put in Jo, quickly,
as he saw a frown on Jim's face and was afraid
that he was going to say something abruptly.
"You will want to give Caliente a good rest, so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
that when we start, we will make the distance
without delay. Then we have to make some preparations
ourselves."</p>

<p>Jim looked at his brother with a moment's dark
suspicion, but it was evident that Jo was perfectly
sincere in what he said.</p>

<p>"I will promise, Senor," said the Spaniard with
a peculiar smile, "that when we start which will
be early tomorrow morning, that we will travel
far and fast enough to suit you and your horse."
There was a challenge in his voice that Jim met
smilingly.</p>

<p>"So be it, Senor," he said, "I will try to be in
sight at the finish."</p>

<p>"My horse is a remarkable animal for speed
and endurance, I must tell you frankly," said the
Senor gravely. "He has no equal in this country
of California. He has proved it more than once
and against all comers."</p>

<p>"He is certainly a fine horse," admitted Jim,
looking at the sorrel with admiring eyes. "He
has a splendid stride."</p>

<p>"Ah, no, Senor," laughed the Spaniard with a
gleam of his white teeth, "I did not mean him,"
patting the horse on the neck, "a good animal, indeed,
but more for my little sister to ride than for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
me. Wait, my friend, until I introduce you to
Don Fernando and then you will see a horse for
the first time."</p>

<p>"I should be very much pleased to see him,"
said Jim, frankly curious and interested.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow," said the Spaniard.</p>

<p>They had now turned into the narrow trail
among the bushes and had only ridden a few steps
when Jo called a sudden halt.</p>

<p>"What do you think, Jim, there's my horse and
Tom's tied in that thicket."</p>

<p>Sure enough there they were, utterly worn out,
but with spirit enough to recognize their old comrades
Jim and Jo, and if ever horses expressed a
welcome these two did when they first caught
sight of their two friends.</p>

<p>"They have cut the saddles to pieces, the
brutes," exclaimed Jo.</p>

<p>"I'm glad to get the horses," said Jim, "I am
surprised that they didn't cut their throats."</p>

<p>"They will follow us all right," said Jo, in reply
to the Spaniard's suggestion that they would have
to be led, and they trotted along behind Jo, who
was the last one in line.</p>

<p>"Do you know of any place where we could buy
things?" asked Jim. "We need a new outfit."</p>

<p>"But we have no money," put in Jo quickly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will get the money or its equivalent today,"
said Jim. "If there is a store where the Senor can
get me credit."</p>

<p>"Yes, there is a store where a Portugee sells
about everything that we need in this country,"
replied the Spaniard. "It is some distance to the
north. We will ride there before we return to
the ranch. There will be no difficulty about the
credit," he concluded, with a bow to Jim.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3>THE BOYS PUT ON STYLE</h3>


<p>"You do not know my ability to spend," said Jim,
"I may have to plunge to the extent of several hundred
dollars. You see my brother has very expensive
tastes. It will cost quite a small fortune when
I buy him a complete trousseau including diamonds."</p>

<p>"I will pledge my lands if necessary to get the
young Senor diamonds," said the Spaniard laughingly.</p>

<p>In about an hour's time they came to a large one
story frame building painted a rather light blue,
which color had weathered a good deal. It had a
square, false front with a sign on it that read, "Mr.
Gonsalves, General Trader."</p>

<p>They hitched their horses to some well graveled
posts, and went inside leaving Jo's and Tom's horses
free to graze at will around, or to stand under
the shelter of some drooping pepper tree across the
road. The proprietor, a short, thick-set Portugee
with a close trimmed black beard, and a gray slouch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
hat which he always wore, apparently, received them
graciously. The contents of the store were entirely
at their service,&mdash;if they paid for them.</p>

<p>"We will miss poor Tom here," said Jo, "he was
always our purchasing agent."</p>

<p>"And a mighty good one," added Jim. "Not even
a Connecticut Yankee could get the best of him in a
bargain."</p>

<p>The Spaniard sat in a round armed wooden chair,
gracefully smoking a cigarette, while his guests
busied themselves making purchases. First the boys
bought some new clothes, which they retired behind
a counter to put on, and emerged in proper apparel
for the plains.</p>

<p>Blue flannel shirts, and pants of the same color,
held up by leather belts, with much glitter of silver
on them, then they bought a sombrero apiece,
not after the Mexican style, but of the American
type. Jim had a red band around his and Jo had a
blue.</p>

<p>"Now we want some handkerchiefs to tie around
our necks," said Jo.</p>

<p>"Of course," remarked Jim with a wink, "something
that will catch the eyes of the ladies."</p>

<p>So M. Gonsalves brought out a brilliant assortment
of handkerchiefs.</p>

<p>"Here's a very fine article, gents," he said hold<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>ing
out a red silk handkerchief, clustered with white
horseshoes.</p>

<p>"Nothing the matter with that," admitted Jim admiringly,
with a droll look at Jo. "But this plain red
one will suit me. My brother would probably like
the horseshoe one." But Jo also declined.</p>

<p>"I will take the dark blue one," he said, "it
matches my costume better."</p>

<p>"Gee! but you will look like a color scheme,"
laughed Jim, "blue eyes, blue pants, shirt, tie and
socks, and hat band, you ought to be a sailor on the
blue Pacific."</p>

<p>"The next things are boots," remarked Jo.</p>

<p>"Not for me," said Jim briefly, "I want moccasins.
Worn 'em all my life, and I am not going to
change to boots now."</p>

<p>"Fine line of moccasins," said the accommodating
Mr. Gonsalves in his best trade manner. You see he
had been in business in San Francisco and knew
something of the ways of customers.</p>

<p>"But it gives us more style to wear boots. You
notice that all the inhabitants wear them, we can
buy moccasins too. You wear them all the time and
they will set you down for an Indian."</p>

<p>"When a fellow once gets the idea of style in his
head," said Jim resignedly, "nothing this side of
matrimony is going to stop him. So lay on Mac<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>Duff
and cursed be he who first cries hold, enough."</p>

<p>"I feel like I was anchored," commented Jim,
stepping across the floor with heavy tread. "I
should like to stalk a deer or an Indian in these
things. He could tell you were arriving before you
got above the horizon."</p>

<p>"But you look fine in 'em," said Jo.</p>

<p>It was true that he made a striking figure in his
blue togs. The lithe powerful physique, and the
strong, resolute face.</p>

<p>"Better look out, Jo," grinned Jim. "No Senorita
would look at you, when they see me dashing
over the landscape."</p>

<p>"I'm a pretty stylish looking guy myself," responded
Jo, confidently. He did make a good appearance,
there was no doubt of that. Though
slighter than his brother he was well set up, and his
frame was well muscled. He was handsomer than
Jim. But there was no nonsense about either of
the two boys and they never gave an unnecessary
thought to their appearance.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Gonsalves," said Jim, "we would like
to look at some of your man-killers."</p>

<p>"Revolvers?" he questioned, "just step this way.
I can fit you out all right."</p>

<p>He did have a fine collection and Jim examined<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
the different ones carefully, noting their action and
how easily they worked.</p>

<p>"I see you are no tenderfoot," complimented the
proprietor. "You have handled shooting irons before."</p>

<p>"I'll be a tenderfoot before long, if I wear these
condemned boots you sold me," said Jim gruffly
ignoring the compliment. He did not care especially
for M. Gonsalves' style. "Now let's have a look at
your rifles." The proprietor actually took off his
hat and bowed.</p>

<p>It was evident that the distinguished gentlemen
from nowhere in particular were going to buy out
his entire stock.</p>

<p>"Would you be so gracious as to step this way?"
he said, "I have the rifles in the back of the store."</p>

<p>They were so gracious, and after due examination
they selected a couple of well balanced guns and
purchased enough ammunition to stand off a few
Indian raids. All the stuff besides what they had
on their backs they packed upon Tom's horse, as
Tom was not present to resent the indignity.</p>

<p>"Now the last things are some saddles," said
Jim, "seeing that our kind friends, the pirates, cut
up those we owned."</p>

<p>"Senor Darlington," said the Spaniard coming
forward and touching Jim lightly on the arm, "Do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
not speak of buying saddles. I will see to that."
Jim did not know exactly what their host meant but
he thanked him and deferred to his request.</p>

<p>Now behold the frontier boys in complete costume,
with glittering revolvers at their hips and
rifles swung across their backs, upon their hands
were fringed buckskin gloves. They had gone the
whole hog as Jim said.</p>

<p>"I'll take the shine off this costume in about one
day," said Jim grimly, "when I get in the open, I
would rather break a broncho, than a new suit of
clothes." There was no doubt about his impressive
appearance, as the sun flashed on the metal of the accoutrements
and he swung himself into the saddle.
Even their host seemed to hold them in higher regard.
Different people, different manners.</p>

<p>When they reached the house ranch the first thing
Jim did was to find Caliente. He was in the long
adobe stable that was a half-mile from the house, at
the beginning of a wide mountain valley, where the
air drew through from the sea.</p>

<p>"How are you, Caliente old fellow," cried Jim, as
he opened the box stall and went in to shake hands
with his old comrade. But the horse leaped to one
side, and then reared up as if to strike Jim.</p>

<p>"He don't know you," cried Jo who was on the
outside of the stall. "Take off your hat."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>Jim whirled it out of the stall, and a change came
over Caliente. He recognized his master, and nickering
in recognition he rubbed his head against
Jim's shoulder, and took playful nips at his fine new
shirt, while Jim fairly hugged him, and gave him
resounding whacks with his open hand upon his
splendid sides and shoulders.</p>

<p>"A magnificent animal, Senor Darlington," said
Senor Sebastian to Jim, "I congratulate you."</p>

<p>It was a true word. Caliente with his proud neck,
small but shapely head, powerful but not too heavy
frame, and color of mottled gray was magnificent.</p>

<p>All that afternoon Jim busied himself grooming
his horse until his coat fairly glistened. He looked
carefully to his feed, and saw to his watering. For
Jim was determined that his horse should not be
beaten by the Spaniard's. He knew that the latter's
horse must be an unusual animal. It was not a short
race, instead, one of two hundred miles that lay before
them on the morrow.</p>

<p>That evening the American boys presented a better
appearance than they did at breakfast. It was a
pretty scene that evening in the long dining room.
The snowy table lit by light of candles and set with
ancient silver brought from Spain. The young
Senorita was seated at her brother's right, and on
the other side were James Darlington and his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
brother Joseph. As to the impression she made
upon them, we will say nothing, as this is not a romance,
but they had a merry and delightful evening.</p>

<p>Their host and the young Senorita were much
interested in hearing of the adventures of the boys
in Mexico, especially that part that referred to
the rescue of the Senorita Cordova from the hands
of Cal Jenkins and his gang. I do not know that
The Frontier Boys told it with any less fervor
because the eyes of the young girl, seated opposite,
were fixed intently upon them. It appeared
that their host knew of the Senor Cordova, who was
a man of prominence in his country, though he had
not actually met him. So there was one more
bond of sympathy between the Senor Sebastian
and James and Jo Darlington.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3>ON BOARD THE SEA EAGLE</h3>


<p>Let us now turn our interest and attention for
a time to the cruise of the Sea Eagle, under the
guidance of that redoubtable free-booter, Captain
Broom. It was a mystery to the three who
watched the ship turn to the South, what her port
could be. We will soon be in a position to solve
that problem.</p>

<p>No sooner had the Sea Eagle cleared the cove
than Captain Broom went to his cabin to go over
his spoils which he had taken from the frontier
boys. He placed all the belts upon the table, took
up one, and with a keen knife slit the first pouch.
A large heavy Spanish coin rolled out and then
clinked down upon the table.</p>

<p>The Captain's eyes glistened. "By Gosh!" he exclaimed,
"it was worth while rounding up those
fellows. They must have struck it rich down in
Mexico. I bet the boys will be tickled to death
to get their share." For whatever crimes and
shortcomings Captain Broom could be charged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
with, at least he always divided fairly with his crew.
Thereby he held their loyalty. It was not all
policy, either, for there was a sterling streak in
the bad old fellow.</p>

<p>Out of the next pouch there glittered upon the
table several diamonds and a small palm full of
rubies, with their rich color and radiance. "The
boys will have enough to start a jewelry store,"
commented the Captain. "But I am not surprised
at this haul. I know something about the hidden
treasures myself, and they do say Mexico is the
the place for them."</p>

<p>Out of another belt he got some ingots of gold
and a girdle that caused the Captain to open his
eyes. At first he did not know what to make of
it. When he held it up he saw that it was formed
of golden disks linked with strings of rubies and
sapphires. In the third belt was a necklace that
might have been worn by some Princess of the
Incas. It was oddly, almost <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'wierdly'">weirdly</ins> beautiful.</p>

<p>The fourth belt that he picked up chanced to belong
to Jim.</p>

<p>"This seems lighter than the others," remarked
the Captain. "Three of the pouches are empty."
His face got black with rage. For instantly his
mind leaped to the suspicion that one of his men
had rifled it. If such had been the case, the guilty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
party would have got short shift at the end of a
rope from the yard arm.</p>

<p>But the second examination showed that the
cut was an old one.</p>

<p>"So!" he cried, "one of the boys has cached part
of his share. I bet it was that long-legged, black-haired
guy. That fellow would give the best of
us trouble. I wish I had him to train. Maybe,
I can make something of the Injun boy," meaning
Juarez.</p>

<p>As to the belts, the shrewd old fellow, to make
sure, measured them to see where the worn holes
of the leather came, and the partially empty belt
had been worn two inches longer than any of the
others.</p>

<p>"It was the big fellow's," said the Captain.</p>

<p>Then he went upon deck and called the crew
forward.</p>

<p>"Now, lads, choose your man to get your share
of the goods," he said.</p>

<p>"It's Jack Cales, sir," they said, knowing that
they would be called upon to select a man to take
their share.</p>

<p>"All right! Come, lad," said the Captain, and
led the way to his cabin. When Jack Cales saw
the treasures on the table, he opened his eyes and
mouth in astonishment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, Sir," he exclaimed, "we haven't seen
anything like this since the day two years ago
when&mdash;" he stopped suddenly, seeing from a look
in the Captain's eyes that no reminiscences were
desired.</p>

<p>"This is your share, lad," said the Captain,
gruffly.</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," responded Cales, as he swept
the small pile of gold and jewels into the palm of
his big hands.</p>

<p>"And mind ye, lad," warned the Captain, "I
don't want any quarreling among yourselves or
ye will hear from me."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir," replied the sailor and backed
out of the cabin.</p>

<p>There was an interesting gathering in the forecastle
when Jack Cales deposited his handful of
treasures on the top of a sea chest that had been
hauled out for the purpose.</p>

<p>For once it was not necessary to have the lantern
lit, for a broad band of sunshine shone down
the steep ladder and cut a golden swath through
the dingy gloom and fell athwart the chest and illuminated
the group: the tall and swaggering
Cales, the rugged, grizzled Pete, and the other
sailormen; a typical group and not to be matched
for picturesqueness anywhere; with their faces<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
intent upon the center of the old black sea chest,
where glowed and glittered the gold and jewels in
the band of light that shone upon some of the
faces of the intent group, while others were in the
shadow. It was a scene such as Rembrandt&mdash;pardon,
kind reader, I forgot for a moment, this
is a simple narrative of Adventure.</p>

<p>"Pete," said Cales, "how the ladies will love you
when they see a chain of glittering diamonds
around your throat."</p>

<p>"One thing is certain, lad," replied the grizzled
Pete, "I won't be givin' none of my diamonds
away to the ladies. I'll keep the stones safe in my
jeans."</p>

<p>"You'll have to be keerful, Pete," rallied another,
"they'll be marrying you for your ill-gotten
wealth, when they find out that you are an heiress.
You can't help yourself, Pete. It won't make any
difference because you are a pirate, that won't
scare 'em. Not when they see them jewels."</p>

<p>"What's the use of you boys a talkin' to me,"
he said with a wise wink, "you're only kittens. I'm
sixty year old and I'm a free man yit."</p>

<p>"Here's a pill for you, Pop," said Cales,
dropping a diamond into his horny hand.</p>

<p>"Gee! I'm just as well pleased to get this as I
was to get a bunch of popcorn when I was a kid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
back in New England, off the Christmas tree."</p>

<p>"Better have it sot in one of your front teeth,
Pop," said Jack. This produced a roar of laughter,
for Pete's front teeth were conspicuous by
their absence.</p>

<p>So the distribution went on without any bickering
at first, only jovial jokes, but at last there
came a bone of contention over the last diamond.
And in a jiffy Jack Cales and a short, stocky sailor
were all tangled up in a fierce encounter. Their
comrades, none too gently, hoisted them up on
deck. There they continued their fight.</p>

<p>No sooner did Captain Broom see them than he
cluttered down from the bridge at a furious rate.
The two combatants ought to have taken warning
but they were deaf to everything except their own
struggle. He was livid with anger, and his
wrath was in a large measure justified.</p>

<p>"I'll larn you!" he yelled, grabbing each by the
back of the neck. "You won't fight any more this
trip."</p>

<p>They were like children in his hands. He had
not only the arms of a gorilla, but the strength of
one when he was aroused and it was a caution the
way he slammed them around, flaying the deck
with them, and dashing their heads together. It
seemed as if every bone in their bodies would be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
broken. Finally he flung them unconscious on the
deck.</p>

<p>"Put them in the Sagenette," he ordered the
mate.</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir," he replied, and with the aid of
one of the sailors, they were chained in a narrow
cell.</p>

<p>Here was where Juarez and Tom came in. As
the two fighters were knocked out and locked up,
it made the crew short and they were ordered out
on deck from the cabin where they had been kept.
Almost famished though they were, they had to
jump in and work like nailers, not to say, sailors.</p>

<p>Fortunately for them, they had experienced a
hard schooling in many different ways since they
came west and were practical masters of several
lines of industry, but this was their first experience
sailoring. It was a hard school, but they
learned more in a few days, than they would have
under months of more gentle tuition. This was
to stand them in good stead when they started on
their cruise to Hawaii.</p>

<p>"I'll get even with those fellows," growled Tom
as he passed near Juarez who was busy polishing
some brass work. "Yes, if it takes the rest of my
life."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>"What do you mean, stopping and gabbing, you
little shrimp?" roared the mate who chanced to see
Tom stop.</p>

<p>And he rushed up and grabbing Tom by the
back of the neck, shook him ferociously, landing
him a couple of kicks at the same time. This was
too much for Juarez, who poised a stone that he
was using and was about to brain the mate with it
when the Captain's iron grip fell on his arm. He
didn't throw that brick.</p>

<p>"Easy, lad," said the Captain. "No more fighting
on board this ship, or I'll take a hand again
and don't you two lads pass the time of day either.
You won't be killed if you work hard and keep
cheerful." Then he gave the mate a look, which
that worthy understood and Tom was allowed to
go about his work without further molestation.</p>

<p>But this was a new and hard doctrine that the
Captain had laid down that the boys had to take
hard usage and unceasing work and keep cheerful
about it. They soon found that the Skipper
meant what he said. It was a bitter lesson, but
perhaps they were the manlier for learning it so
young. For it's something that life hands out to
everyone sooner or later.</p>

<p>Often the boys looked longingly over the rail
towards the faint, far outline of the California<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
coast. The Skipper was keeping his ship far out
from the land for reasons best known to himself.
One thing was favorable in that the sea air had
braced up Juarez so that he felt more like himself
though his head was queer at times. And no
wonder for that blow the Mexican dwarf had
given him was sufficient to have stunned an ox.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<h3>A DAY AT SEA</h3>


<p>The Sea Eagle was steaming steadily South to her
mysterious harbor. The day was a brilliant one and
as the afternoon wore on the wind from the Northwest
began to blow with fresher force and the white
caps began to jump, here, there and everywhere
over the broad surface of the ocean, and then slide
down on the back of the waves.</p>

<p>There was a good deal of motion on the part of
the Sea Eagle now, as she plunged into the waves
and threw the spray back over her decks. Both
Juarez and Tom proved themselves good sailors,
which was just as well for if they had been sea sick
together with their other miseries they might have
succumbed.</p>

<p>Finally the long afternoon wore away and the
time came for supper. The boys being neither
flesh, fish or fowl, were not allowed to eat with the
crew, and they did not mind in the least. When
their rations did arrive, or rather when they went<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
to the ship's galley and got their share, they
found the fare not lacking in quality and abundance.
There was a heaping plate of Mexican beans, a big
hunk of bread and a bowl of hot tea. After the
boys had stowed this below in their hatches they felt
a hundred per cent better and more fit to meet any
fate that might await them.</p>

<p>An hour before sunset a heavy bank of fog began
to roll up from the West, soon covering the
whole sky with its gracious softness, and decided
restfulness, after the glittering blue-diamond beauty
of the day.</p>

<p>It is the fogs alone that make the climate of California,
especially in the Southern part endurable.
Too much sunshine becomes as unbearable as too
much cloudiness.</p>

<p>The sea went down, when the fog came up and the
waters took on a steely color under their blanket of
gray, rolling on, in that monotonous meditation
that holds the mystery of forgotten ages in its
brooding.</p>

<p>"Here's where you will sleep, boys," said Old Pete,
who had been appointed by the Captain to have
special charge over their education. "The men won't
have you in the fo'castle, and it's pretty crowded
there anyway."</p>

<p>"This will suit us, sir," replied Juarez. He did<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
not call him Pop, as he would have on the land. This
was the sea and had its own rules and customs,
therefore Old Pete received his due of respect. But
in his rough way he was not unfriendly towards the
boys, for he remembered that they had given him
friendly advice, when he was aboard that strange
craft, a horse, the night before.</p>

<p>The place where the boys were to sleep was a sort
of cubby hole in the bow of the boat, that was roofed
over and where anchor chains and other junk was
sometimes kept. It was not over four feet high,
five in width at the broadest and narrowing to the
bow.</p>

<p>A rude place to sleep in, but what did the Frontier
Boys care for that? They could scarcely count the
nights that they had slept out on the ground, and in
bad weather too. They had a blanket apiece, and a
tarpaulin to pull over them.</p>

<p>The blankets they had spread out on the floor of
the cubby hole and they found that the tarpaulin
made a mighty warm protective covering,
keeping out the damp sea air in fine style.</p>

<p>"Where do you suppose we are heading for,
Juarez?" inquired Tom.</p>

<p>"Maybe a port in Mexico or South America and
then again we may head for Hawaii before we intend
to."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>"We are going South now, though," said Tom.</p>

<p>"If we run in close to the coast, we'll jump overboard,
and swim for it," said Juarez.</p>

<p>"We could do it if we get within a mile," said
Tom, "if it is not too rough."</p>

<p>Just then Juarez put his hand over Tom's mouth,
he felt sure that someone was listening or was preparing
to. Juarez ran his fingers carefully over the
boards until he found where a hole had been bored
through the planking a little back of their heads. It
was just as he had suspected, someone was listening
to hear what plans they would make.</p>

<p>With the noiselessness characteristic of him when
scouting, Juarez crept out partially and cautiously
raised his head until he caught sight of the sole of
a man's boot. Then he crept back to his place and
gave Tom a nudge. Forthwith they began talking in
rather loud tones.</p>

<p>"Say Tom, do you know I rather like this ship.
These fellows are rough in their way but that is to
be expected."</p>

<p>"Of course," said Tom, in an equally loud voice,
"but we might as well make the best of it. There is
no chance for the boys to find us."</p>

<p>"You're right there, Tom."</p>

<p>Then in a short time they appeared to fall into a
deep and sonorous sleep. This was no fake on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
part of Tom who was actually and thoroughly
tired. But Juarez was more of a veteran and he
kept his eyes open and he was rewarded in a few
minutes by seeing a man's feet hanging <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'ever'">over</ins> the
edge of their bunk house and then he saw the figure
of the mate slouch aft.</p>

<p>"You sly old rascal, you," remarked Juarez. "We
will 'larn' you to try and be too smart with the
Frontier Boys. We may be young but we are not
fools."</p>

<p>Nothing happened for a while and the gentle
plunge of the Sea Eagle into the long rolling swell
soon lulled the tired Juarez into a sound sleep, so
that neither he nor Tom were aware that the ship
had suddenly changed her course.</p>

<p>By and by however, Juarez waked with a start.
Something had happened, he knew not what. He sat
up and struck his head upon the planking overhead.
Fortunately however he did not hit the place where
the Mexican had struck him but at the best his head
was a tender place with him and the blow stunned
him, but as he was now more his rugged self, he
soon recovered.</p>

<p>He found what had wakened him was the stopping
of the ship. He saw several dark forms moving
aft and he crept out to see what was afoot. He
had to move very carefully but managed to reach the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
hood of the forecastle, where he crouched looking
and listening.</p>

<p>He saw that they were lying to, close in to shore
and could see the white splash of the breakers as
they rolled towards the shore and could hear their
monotonous thunder upon the beach. Here perhaps
was their chance. Just then he heard the heavy
voice of the Captain from the bridge.</p>

<p>"Lower away there." Then the starboard boat
slid noiselessly down from the davits into the
water.</p>

<p>Juarez got up and glided back into the cubby hole
to tell Tom the good news. It was their opportunity
to escape and seemingly a good one. The sea was
smooth and the night was dark. They could slip
over the side of the vessel and pull for the shore,
and not a soul on the Sea Eagle would be the wiser
until they looked into their nest in the morning to
find it empty.</p>

<p>Once they got to the shore it would be an easy
matter to make their way North until they met Jim
and Jo.</p>

<p>The anticipation of the escape had already thrilled
through every nerve in Juarez's body. But he had
just started to wake Tom, when something made
him look down the deck. There was the tall figure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
of one of the sailors coming directly towards the
bow.</p>

<p>Juarez lay down quickly as though asleep. Then
the man reached down and caught hold of Tom's
foot and Juarez's and gave them a rough yank. "So
you are here, you young brats. You had better
make a move or the Cap'n will finish you."</p>

<p>Juarez was fairly sizzling with rage especially as
Tom was really frightened by being wakened in such
rough fashion and after all Tom was but a boy and
it pained Juarez to see him so scared, but he was
helpless, and all he could do was to add one more
black mark to the score he was charging up to the
free-booters.</p>

<p>Instead of moving away, the man sat on a capstan
a few feet distant from the boys' den, watching for
the slightest move on their part, a marlin spike dangling
playfully in his hands. Juarez had not taken
the crafty and keen sighted Captain Broom into account.</p>

<p>From the Bridge, that worthy, although he was
watching the launching of the boat, had chanced to
catch sight out of the tail of his eye of a dark
shadow flitting back to the forecastle. He was not
sure it was one of the boys, but he was taking no
chances, for he had a real respect for their prowess
and audacity as he might well have.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>So he had sent one of his crew to guard this
young lions' den, while the ship was so close in
shore. He did not intend to stay longer than was
necessary right at this point, and he waited with
some anxiety for the return of the mate and Pete
in the boat.</p>

<p>It was now two o'clock in the morning and Captain
Broom wanted to be out at sea a good safe
distance before the light broke. The mate's boat
had now been gone over a half-hour, and the Captain
stood at the end of the Bridge looking towards
the shore. There was not a light upon the vessel to
show her position. She lay silent and black upon the
dark waters.</p>

<p>Then the Captain straightened up. He saw a
moving body approaching the ship and heard the
slight dip of oars. Then the boat was alongside and
instead of two men, there were three in the boat.
The Captain went down to the main deck to meet
them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<h3>THE PASSENGER</h3>


<p>They met without any formality. The new
passenger was a tall, slightly stooped man, with
long hair falling down to his shoulders. Juarez
was exceedingly anxious to see him, but could
make out only a dark form moving along the deck.</p>

<p>"Come to the cabin, Jeems," called the Captain.
"I've got something to tell ye."</p>

<p>They were soon seated in the Captain's cabin.
This was a good-sized room, panelled in light
wood and very neatly kept. There was quite a
broad table of the same wood as the walls and a
swivel chair in front of it. The Captain seated
himself in this chair and whirled to talk to the
visitor from the shore.</p>

<p>It was evident that he was not a temporary visitor
for scarcely had they seated themselves in the
cabin than the Sea Eagle slowly and gently turned
and they felt the pulsation of her engines as she
headed once more for sea. The man was seated
on a sea chest opposite the Captain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>He wore long cowhide boots, with jeans pants
thrust into their tops, flannel shirt of a nondescript
color and a corduroy jacket. His hat was
of a battered gray. The face was smooth-shaven,
deeply lined and burnt to a dull brown. The hair
which came down to his shoulders had that peculiar
sun-burnt weathered tinge that comes from
continual exposure to the weather. He was not
an old man, probably on the sunny side of forty.</p>

<p>"Well, Jeems, what is your news?" inquired the
Captain.</p>

<p>"The government boat is in the harbor, that's
all." The Captain gave a low, peculiar whistle.</p>

<p>"When did she show up?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Two days ago, Cap'n," he replied.</p>

<p>"Come from the South?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the man. "Put in for coal, I
reckon."</p>

<p>"Then put out for us," said the Captain briefly.</p>

<p>"Any 'baccy, Cap'n? Been out two days," remarked
Jeems.</p>

<p>"Lift your lanky frame off that chest," replied
the Captain, "and I'll git you some."</p>

<p>The man sprang up with remarkable alacrity,
and as he unfolded length after length of his long
figure, it seemed as if his head would touch the
ceiling of the cabin. In fact, he did not miss it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
by many inches. It was a comical contrast between
the short stooping figure of the Captain and
the tall stranger.</p>

<p>"Waal, Jeems, I wouldn't advise you to grow
any more, or I'll have to raise the roof of my
cabin."</p>

<p>"That's what, Cap'n," replied Jeems imperturbably.
"That's what happens when you grow up in
Californy. You grow all the year around, and not
like in New England where the winters makes you
stubby."</p>

<p>Then the native philosopher seated himself on
the chest again and took long and delightful pulls
at his recently staked pipe.</p>

<p>"Hum!" he said. "This tastes right. Did yer
ever know what it war to be starved for yer
'baccy, Cap'n?"</p>

<p>"No," replied the Captain, "I can't say that I
ever did."</p>

<p>"Well, I want to tell you, Cap'n, that it is worse
than going without water and I know what that is.
Been on a desert till my tongue was as thick as a
cow's, and hung out between my teeth, black."</p>

<p>"How long have you been away?" inquired the
Captain.</p>

<p>"Three weeks, Cap'n."</p>

<p>"How are the sheep lookin'?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>"Pretty fair, Cap'n," he replied. "I think that
they had a whiff of rain over there a few days
ago."</p>

<p>"It won't be long till we git the rains," suggested
the Captain.</p>

<p>"I don't know, Cap'n," remarked the lanky one.
"The climate of Californy is a curious proposition.
It's built on the bias down at this end."</p>

<p>"How's that?" asked the Captain curiously.
He had a certain interest in this particular courier's
theories, however he might laugh at their peculiarities.
For there was apt to be a basis of
reason in them.</p>

<p>"Well, it's this way, Cap'n," said James Howell,
to give him his correct name, thrusting one lanky
hand deep into his jeans pocket and bending forward
awkwardly. "It's this way. You see the
storms come down from the North to the Tehatchipei
mountains, where there isn't any way for them
to get through to the south. Then the clouds
shift around to Arizony, and if the wind is right
they are blown through the passes of the Sierra
Madre into Southern Californy, then we get the
rain. That's why I said, Cap'n, that this dazzling
climate is built on the bias."</p>

<p>"Waal, Jeems, as a weather prophet you can't
be beat," said the Skipper.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>"In my business I get plenty of time to think,
Cap'n," he remarked, "and as they ain't much to
see except climate I think about that."</p>

<p>"Waal, I have a good sight more than that to
consider," replied the Skipper. "I'm thinking
right now about that government boat. I'm going
on deck. You can turn in."</p>

<p>The Captain showed him to an empty cabin and
the lanky stranger proceeded to make himself
comfortable for the balance of the night, while the
Captain went up on the Bridge.</p>

<p>"Where are you heading this boat to?" he
asked gruffly of the man at the wheel.</p>

<p>Then he took the helm himself and immediately
the Sea Eagle's prow pointed to the Westward as
if she were heading directly for Japan. However,
she held this course for only an hour and a
half when the Skipper swung her bow once more
to the South.</p>

<p>Long before the morning broke, Tom and
Juarez, hauled out of their resting place, were set
to scrubbing the decks and rubbing them down
with holy-stone. They waited eagerly for the first
break of day to see where they were.</p>

<p>Then the light came slowly through the fog-covered
sky, showing a glossy sea with a slight
swell and not a sign of land anywhere. The boys'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
hearts sank within them and they felt sure that
they would not see their native land again.</p>

<p>Once in a while they would glance up at the
Bridge where stood the Captain with his powerful
stooped figure. He was evidently on the lookout,
for with his eye at a long glass, he kept scanning
the sky-line to the east. What was he looking
for? Juarez knew instinctively that he was afraid
of pursuit.</p>

<p>If only they could be overtaken and captured,
his heart thrilled at the thought and he watched
the Captain eagerly for the first sign of excitement.
About ten o'clock he saw by the Skipper's
actions that something of interest had come under
his observation.</p>

<p>There were a number of quick, sharp orders
given and Juarez noticed the increased volume of
smoke pouring from the stack. The Sea Eagle
began to show the speed that was in her trim,
black form. Juarez worked around the port side
of the boat as rapidly as he dared, and his heart
leaped with hope.</p>

<p>He saw low upon the eastern horizon a smudge
of black smoke. If he only had known what the
Skipper knew, his hopes would have risen still
higher. Certain preparations were going on upon
deck. The three cannon, one in the stern,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
that had fired the salute to the group on the shore,
one on either side of the quarter-deck, were divested
of their canvas jackets.</p>

<p>They certainly gleamed bravely in their polished
brass. Then the ammunition was got ready <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'besiide'">beside</ins>
each separate gun. It begin to look like
business. The Sea Eagle began to justify her
name and fly through the water. Still the spot
upon the horizon grew bigger.</p>

<p>Then Juarez began to have a paralyzing feeling
of doubt. The steamer, though coming up
fast, did not seem to be steering the proper course
to head the Sea Eagle, bearing on her port-quarter
instead of across her bows as would have been
the natural course if she wished to intercept her.</p>

<p>Then the doubt in his mind was changed to disappointed
certainty for the Skipper waved his
hand to the mate, who was busy on the deck below.
It was after he had taken a pull at the spyglass,
which this time seemed to have an intoxicating
effect upon the Captain.</p>

<p>"It's all right, Bill," he yelled, "It's nothing but
a steamer bound for 'Frisco. It looks like the
Panama."</p>

<p>Juarez and Tom resumed their work doggedly.
That was all that was left for them to do. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
scarcely glanced at the big steamer as she appeared,
growing constantly larger above the horizon,
and then diminishing as she steamed North
towards San Francisco.</p>

<p>Juarez was scrubbing the deck near a cabin door
when it suddenly opened, and a tall, long-legged
figure stepped out and fairly over him. He came
to the conclusion that it was the man who had
come aboard the night before.</p>

<p>He took in the tall, gaunt man with the smooth-shaven
face and long hair at two glances&mdash;one
not being sufficient to his height.</p>

<p>"Well, who are you?" he inquired lounging on
the rail and regarding Juarez with mild-eyed interest.</p>

<p>"I'm Juarez Hopkins, deck scrubber. Who are
you?"</p>

<p>"I'm James Howell, sheep farmer. I'll add
you two lambs to my flock," he replied, whimsically,
glancing at Tom who was down the deck
a way.</p>

<p>"You are more apt to find us wolves in lamb's
hide," retorted Juarez. "Where's your farm?"</p>

<p>"There," said the stranger, pointing with a long,
bony finger on the port-quarter, "that nigh island."</p>

<p>Then Juarez saw to his surprise, two islands<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
that seemed to have sprung like magic upon the
South-eastern horizon. The further one lay long
and low and dark but distant beneath the fog-lined
sky, the "nigh one" was more short and dumpy in
appearance.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<h3>TO THE RESCUE</h3>


<p>During the afternoon, everything had been made
ready for the journey of the morrow. There was
not a great deal to be done for the three rescuers
would travel light. There would be no need of a
pack animal, because the Senor had assured the
boys that they would find hospitality on the way.</p>

<p>Jo however was in mourning because when he
gave his black a trial gallop, it was discovered that
he was badly lamed in the right knee. It would not
have been safe for any of the pirate gang to come
within range of Jo's wrath.</p>

<p>"The cursed brutes stove him up for fair," he declared
grinding his teeth.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it will take a month's rest before he
will be fit," determined Jim.</p>

<p>"Then I'm out of it," exclaimed Jo sorrowfully.</p>

<p>"Not so, my friend," interrupted the Spaniard.
"Take the bay. He is not as good a horse as yours,
but he has great endurance. He is yours to use as
long as you wish."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>Jo thanked the Spaniard heartily for his kindness
and generosity. Then he spoke in a low voice to his
brother. "How about that money, Jim? Don't forget
to pay the Spaniard for those goods we bought
at the store." Jim spoke up.</p>

<p>"Senor, I wish to show you a little something of
interest."</p>

<p>Then Jim got his heavy saddle, on which he had
ridden so many hundred miles. And the Senor regarded
it with interest, because of the carved leather
workmanship which was of the finest and he was a
connoisseur of such matters.</p>

<p>"How much would you give for it, Senor Sebastian,"
inquired Jim, "if it were put up for purchase?"</p>

<p>"It is a beautiful saddle. I would be willing to
give a hundred dollars. It is worth it."</p>

<p>"That saddle is worth several thousand, Senor,"
replied Jim confidently.</p>

<p>"I do not understand," replied the Spaniard. "It
is the personal value, I suppose."</p>

<p>"I will show you," said Jim.</p>

<p>Then he took from his hip pocket a heavy bone
handled knife which he had bought at the store and
pulled back the hoof cleaner, an instrument attached
to the knife that was used to get a pebble or
anything that had got into the horse's hoof.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>With this he worked at the leather that covered
the high and rather thick horn of the saddle. Finally
he pried the top leather flap off. There was a heavy
piece fitted into the top of the horn. With some
difficulty Jim got this out disclosing a hollow, in
which was concealed most of the jewels he had
found in Mexico.</p>

<p>"Hold your hands, Jo. Tight now." And with
the word he emptied the contents of the horn into
Jo's palms. Diamonds, rubies, turquoises and some
heavy gold pieces.</p>

<p>"That is what you might call a horn of plenty,"
said Jim jocosely.</p>

<p>"But!" cried the Spaniard in amazement, "where
did you get these?"</p>

<p>"In Mexico," replied Jim. "This was what the
Pirates were after. And they got all but this.
Sometime I will tell you the story of its discovery.
Now take this to reimburse you, Senor, for the
money we spent at the store." And he held out the
diamond.</p>

<p>"That is far too much. That stone is worth five
hundred dollars at least," said the Spaniard. "These
three rubies would be more exact and I will take
them."</p>

<p>Jim, handing over the three stones selected, said,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
"Now, Senor, you shall take the diamond as a token
of good will from my brother and myself."</p>

<p>"We insist upon it," chimed in Jo.</p>

<p>Finally the Spaniard accepted the gifts with many
protestations of obligation and appreciation. Jo
was about to urge him to accept a jewel for his
sister, but Jim stopped him, knowing that the proud
Spaniard would not hear to such a present.</p>

<p>The next morning they were up an hour before
daylight and ate a hearty breakfast by the light of
the candles. Veterans though they were, the boys
felt a thrill go through their pulses as they thought
of the expedition that lay before them. Outside they
could hear the pawing of the impatient horses.</p>

<p>"To the success of our expedition and the rescue
of our friends!" was the toast the Spaniard proposed
as they rose from the table. The Frontier Boys
drank it, but not in wine. They felt just a little
foolish too, but such is the reward that often comes
with doing what is right. But they were sturdy in
their determination to stick to their principles.</p>

<p>If they had only known it, down in his heart the
Spaniard respected them the more, even though it
seemed odd to him.</p>

<p>Then they went out on the verandah, fully armed
and ready to take their departure. Two oil lamps
near the door and fastened to the wall, backed by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
shining reflectors sent a strong light across the
verandah and into the darkness outside.</p>

<p>There stood the three horses, eager to be off, each
one held by a Mexican groom. Caliente we already
know, and the horse that Jo is to ride also. So let
us take a glance at the third animal, Don Fernando.
He evidently justified all the enthusiasm of his master,
a truly splendid creature.</p>

<p>A dark chestnut, as large as Caliente and built on
something the same lines. They were beautifully
matched except in color. It was with a thrill of
pleasure that Jim swung himself into the saddle. His
mount was in fine fettle and ready for the long pull
ahead.</p>

<p>They started from the home ranch with a thunder
of hoofs in unison, the riders checking their
horses to a slow gallop with a heavy hand. Together
they pressed through the waning darkness. There
was a wonderful exhilaration, as they leaped forward,
the horses powerful and fresh.</p>

<p>Instead of following in the direction of the morning
before, the Spaniard turned to the East until
they came near the foot of the range. In a short time
they came to a gate, which seemed to open mysteriously
as they approached, but the motive power
proved to be a small Mexican boy, whom the Senor
had sent on ahead.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>Now they were on a turf road with bushes on
either side and down this they thundered, Caliente
the gray, and Don Fernando the dark, matching
stride for stride, with Jo well in the rear. For he
found if he rode close up he was blinded and stung
by sods and stones thrown back from the flying
hoofs of the two horses in the front.</p>

<p>It was a bit lonely for Jo and he wished that one
of the other boys was here to keep him company. As
they rode, the bushes seemed to fly by as they do
when you look from a railroad train and Jo was
afraid lest his horse would be unable to keep the
pace indefinitely. One thing in Jo's favor was that
he was the lightest of the three and what is more to
the purpose a very light rider.</p>

<p>So like the good horseman he was, he determined
to save his horse all he could and make him last out.
For eight miles or more they rode without a stop
until they came to another gate. This the Spaniard
unfastened and swung open without dismounting,
then closed it after Jo.</p>

<p>The morning light was now distinct, although
the fog was over the sky. Before them stretched a
long level plain that broke into sand dunes near the
sea. They could see the ocean lying dark in its
monotonous level of color, to the Western horizon.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>"We have just left the Sebastian ranch," called
the Spaniard.</p>

<p>"It is immense," commented Jim. "May I ask
how many acres it embraces?"</p>

<p>"It was immense in the old days," replied the
Spaniard. "Before your people took possession of
the land. It was held by no fences then. But your
laws were not ours and we lost many square miles.
Now there are fifty thousand acres under fence."</p>

<p>"Fifty thousand acres!" exclaimed Jo.</p>

<p>"Ah, but it was double that before the Americans
came," replied the Spaniard. Then he glanced critically
at Caliente. "Your horse looks as cool as
though he had been standing in the stable. The pace
does not affect his wind either. Splendid condition!"</p>

<p>"Caliente is as hard as nails," said Jim proudly.
"But your horse has wonderful speed."</p>

<p>The chestnut seemed more on edge than the old
warrior, Caliente, and tossed the foam from his bit,
until his dark coat was speckled with it.</p>

<p>"He is high strung," said the Spaniard, "but I
would back him against any horse flesh in California.
We can let them out here for a half dozen miles."</p>

<p>"Let her go, Senor. I won't let you lose me."</p>

<p>At the word the Spaniard gave his chafing horse
his head and away the chestnut sprang in the lead.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
It was slightly down grade for a mile, then there
was a gulch twelve feet wide and of considerable
depth. It was a good jump and to make it saved a
little distance. Going at top speed the chestnut took
the jump in fine style. His rider half turned in his
saddle to watch Jim's effort. Caliente had faced
worse leaps than that, he rose to it and swept over
it as gracefully as a bird.</p>

<p>"Good fellow!" exclaimed Jim patting him affectionately
on the neck.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<h3>THE BANDITS</h3>


<p>When Jo saw the gulch ahead, he decided that
discretion was the better part of valor as he did not
know his mount well enough to risk the leap, so he
galloped a few hundred feet below, where the gulch
narrowed and then he took the jump nicely, and
scampered after the other two riders who were quite
a way ahead.</p>

<p>Jim purposely held Caliente in check, keeping a
hundred yards in the rear of the Spaniard. Ahead
a few miles, there was a perfect sea of yellow where
the tall mustard covered the plain for a great distance.
Into this they charged full tilt, the mustard
reaching as high as their heads.</p>

<p>There was a swish of its blossoms in their faces as
the powerful horses charged into it and in spite of
their strength they began to tire after going some
distance.</p>

<p>"Where is Jo?" inquired Jim suddenly after they
had slowed down, "I don't see a sign of him." And<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
he rose in his stirrups looking over the level lake of
mustard.</p>

<p>"Hello, Jo," he yelled at the top of his voice. No
answer came. Could he be drowned in this lake?
There was not a motion to indicate his whereabouts,
no waving of the yellow tops.</p>

<p>"It is very strange," said the Spaniard. "Did he
cross the gully all right?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I saw him take the jump below us a ways."
Then Jim raised his revolver above his head and
fired.</p>

<p>"That ought to fetch him," he said. Then they
listened intently. Suddenly about a quarter of a
mile ahead of them they saw a sombrero rise like
a gray mushroom above the yellow surface of the
mustard, and Jo's voice came back to them.</p>

<p>They both gave their horses the rein, this time Jim
did nothing to hold Caliente back, and with their
powerful speed the two great horses tore forward,
on even terms until in the last hundred yards Caliente
forged ahead by half a length.<sup>[<a name="tn" id="tn"></a><a href="#note">1</a>]</sup></p>

<p>"Hold on boys," yelled Jo in warning. There was Jo sitting
quietly on his horse.</p>

<p>"That's how you beat us," exclaimed Jim, pointing
to a cow trail running diagonally through the
growth of mustard.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," laughed Jo, "I struck it further down after
I jumped the gully. Otherwise you fellows would
have lost me."</p>

<p>"Good work, Jo," said Jim. "Now we will have it
easier going."</p>

<p>So in single file they galloped along the path, until
they found themselves by noon, at the foot of a spur
of mountains that extended from the main coast
range to the ocean. Jim regarded this barrier in
their way with a practised eye.</p>

<p>"This will slow us down, Senor," he said. "It
looks like a pass below there, about two miles."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Senor, "we can get through there
all right, but it is pretty rough going."</p>

<p>They had to advance more slowly now, as the
ground was broken into stony ravines, and there was
a good deal of brush. In this kind of country Jo's
horse more than held its own with the bigger animals,
for he was as nimble as a goat.</p>

<p>"I hope we will find water, Senor," remarked Jim.
"Our horses are pretty dry now."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the Spaniard, "there is a good
spring at the foot of the Pass."</p>

<p>They found it all right, in the entrance to the
Pass, where there was a small green cove, surrounded
with bushes, and on one side was a sheep
herder's shanty. Jo investigated this immediately<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
and found nothing in it but the charred remnants
of a fire and a pair of discarded overalls.</p>

<p>Jim, who had himself been looking around, made
a more important find.</p>

<p>"There has been somebody here recently," he announced.
"Here are some tracks around the spring
and not over twelve hours old."</p>

<p>"Yes, I have no doubt," said the Spaniard carelessly
puffing at his cigarette. "This Pass is used
occasionally by ranchmen and herders."</p>

<p>"There have been five or six horses here," said
Jim, whose experiences had made him suspicious.</p>

<p>"There are no Indians," said Jo, "in this section,
at least none who are on the warpath."</p>

<p>"I <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'supose'">suppose</ins> you do have cattle rustlers, Senor?"
inquired Jim.</p>

<p>"Yes, there is a band of outlaws," replied the
Spaniard, "that raids from as far north as our
ranch, south to San Diego, but we have seen no
trace of them for many months."</p>

<p>"Then, Senor," remarked Jim, "it is about time
that they paid you another visit."</p>

<p>"Ah, Senor Darlington," exclaimed the Spaniard.
"We Castilians do not reason so. We say that there
is no trouble today, why worry about tomorrow.
Perhaps these bandits may have starved to death, or
been hung, or the good Padres may have persuaded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
them by the fear of Hell, to become quiet, sheep raising
citizens. God knows."</p>

<p>"I fear that they are raising sheep in their old
style," grinned Jo. The pun glanced off the Spaniard
harmlessly.</p>

<p>"The theory that they may be hung, sounds plausible,
Senor," admitted Jim. "But before we advance
into the Pass, I will scout a little."</p>

<p>"If the Senor pleases," responded the Spaniard
courteously.</p>

<p>"Do you chance to know of a small, hunchbacked
Mexican who is more or less in this section of the
country, Senor?" Jim suddenly inquired.</p>

<p>The Spaniard flushed with red anger and spit emphatically
on the ground.</p>

<p>"You give him into my hands and I will reward
you well," cried the Spaniard.</p>

<p>Jim made no immediate reply but gazed thoughtfully
at the ground. He was considering the case.
This was not the time to turn aside in a chase for
even so desperate a criminal as the hunchbacked
greaser. So he made no definite reply to the Spaniard.</p>

<p>After the horses were fed, and watered, and while
Jo was looking after the coffee, Jim started off, to
do a little scouting up the Pass. The first thing that
he did was to slip off his heavy riding boots, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
the stylish Jo had forced him to buy, and to put on
his noiseless footed moccasins.</p>

<p>Then with his revolver loaded and ready to his
hand, he went swiftly and silently up the trail that
followed through thick brush, gradually working up
the side of the mountain. It was no difficult task to
follow the tracks of the horses. In a half hour's
swift climbing he came to the top of a stony ridge,
over which the trail curved, and dipped down the
other side.</p>

<p>Jim now saw that the Pass was an irregular one
with recurrent spurs, thrusting out from the
mountains on either side, at quite frequent intervals.
There were innumerable chances for ambuscades.
Jim did not stand in the trail but to one side
partially hidden in a thicket.</p>

<p>All the time his keen eyes were taking in the canyon
below, not however admiring the scenery. In
fact there was nothing particularly beautiful, or interesting
in the view. In the Rockies and further
South too he had seen canyons incomparable to the
rather ordinary ones that he had seen in California.</p>

<p>Jim was watching for some slight movement of a
living creature in the canyon. Finally he gave it up,
and was about to turn away, then he gave a start,
he saw one, two, three, men crouch across the trail,
a quarter of a mile below, and disappear into the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
thick brush. He was almost certain that the first
one was the hunchback.</p>

<p>That was all that Jim wanted to see. He noiselessly
took the back trail, thinking over the best
course to pursue. He would have liked nothing better
under ordinary circumstances than to fight it out
with the outlaws and to capture the hunchback.
But their first object must be the rescue of Tom and
Juarez.</p>

<p>Was there not some way by which they could get
to the South without going through this bandit infested
Pass?</p>

<p>"Well brother, what didst thou find?" inquired Jo,
who was at times pleased to be dramatic.</p>

<p>"Very few specimens in the way of bandits," replied
Jim.</p>

<p>"As I said, Senor," remarked the Spaniard, "they
have become good citizens."</p>

<p>"Not yet, I am sure, because they are alive."</p>

<p>"That is a good one, Jim," remarked Jo, appreciatively,
but the Spaniard was politely mystified.
"Same as Indians."</p>

<p>"I found one thing out," said the diplomatic Jim,
"and that is, that the Pass is a hard one on horses.
Are you sure, Senor, that there is no easier way
than this to get through?"</p>

<p>"Positive," briefly responded the Spaniard.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>Jim who was seated on a rock digging his heel
into the soft earth, looked up as a sudden idea struck
him,&mdash;but without knocking him out.</p>

<p>"How far is it from here to the sea, Senor?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Not over five miles."</p>

<p>"Can we not get around that way?" Jim inquired
eagerly.</p>

<p>"Why, yes," replied the Spaniard slowly, "if the
tide is not coming in. In that case we should be
drowned." Jim glanced hastily at his watch.</p>

<p>"We can try for it and make it, if we do not
waste any time," he said. "The horses have had a
good rest."</p>

<p>"Very well, Senor," said the Spaniard resignedly.
He regarded Jim as an amiable hurricane whom it
was not worth while battering to resist. Jim hastily
swallowed his coffee and a hunk of bread and in five
minutes the three musketeers were in the saddle
again.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<h3>RACE WITH THE TIDE</h3>


<p>In spite of the rough going, they made good
time for the five miles, spurred on by the constant
anxiety lest they should not reach the beach before
the tide began coming in. There were several
gathered to see them off when they left the mouth
of the Pass, but not to give them a send off.</p>

<p>A short explanation will prove this. It is not
to be supposed that the hunchbacked Mexican
and the bandits did not know that the three horsemen
were coming over the plain of the mustard
growth. Indeed, their scout, the Mexican dwarf,
saw Jim, Jo and the Spaniard when they first
landed in the entrance to the canyon.</p>

<p>He had gone back to report to the bandits
their coming, and after Jim had returned, they
had prepared the nicest trap imaginable near
where Jim had been hiding. They had had numerous
experiences in that line and were perfectly
qualified experts. The spider and the fly was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
nothing to the arrangements they had made to receive
their supposably unsuspicious guests.</p>

<p>You can imagine the surprise and disgust of the
bandits and their scout when they saw the three
horsemen ride in an entirely different direction
than that they had looked for. Talk about convulsions,
you should have seen these desperadoes
express their disappointment. It was terrific.
Not a saint in the long calendar was left unscathed.</p>

<p>How Jim would have enjoyed the performance.
But entirely oblivious to this, Jo, Jim and the
Spaniard were riding rapidly towards the sea.
Before an hour had passed, they had ridden between
the rounded sand dunes and then out upon
the hard, smooth sand of the beach.</p>

<p>"This is splendid going, Senor Sebastian," exclaimed
Jim.</p>

<p>"It is all right," he replied, "if the sea does not
get hungry too soon." But the sea appeared to be
in a very pleasant mood and the white breakers
had withdrawn as far out as it was possible to get.
It was such a smooth smiling sea with the laugh
of its little sparkling waves that it seemed that
there could be no possible harm in it.</p>

<p>"I never saw a road that was better than this!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
exclaimed Jo in delight. "It is perfectly springy
and no dust or mud."</p>

<p>It deserved all of Jo's praises, this broad, firm
California beach. The brown sand, that had been
pounded down by the force of the great rollers
some hours before, showed scarcely a sign of the
shoes of the horses.</p>

<p>There was plenty of width and the three horses
pressed on abreast, the powerful sweep of the
gray Caliente and the chestnut Don Fernando,
and the snappy, nervous leaps of the little bay that
Jo was riding. With the bracing sea air and the
exhilarating speed, the three musketeers were invigorated.</p>

<p>The Spaniard hummed a gay ballad, while at
times Jim's heavy bass and Jo's lighter treble
were joined in a rollicking American song. They
laughed without reason, for the simple joy of being
alive and on the move; but as pride sometimes
goes before destruction, so happiness often goes
before disaster.</p>

<p>It was a small matter too, but it made for
trouble. The Spaniard's horse stepped between
two small rocks that were close together and
wrenched one of his hind shoes nearly off. Jim
and Senor Sebastian hastily dismounted. Of
course they carried with them the necessary things<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
to fix the shoe on again, but even then it was a
question of a number of minutes.</p>

<p>"You had better ride ahead, Jo," urged Jim.
"Your horse is beginning to tire and we will overtake
you, when we once get started."</p>

<p>"It is a good idea," joined in the Spaniard.</p>

<p>"All right," acquiesced Jo readily enough, and
he gave his bay the rein, riding slowly down the
beach.</p>

<p>Then the two began operations on Don Fernando's
hind foot. Here they found their first real
delay. At the point where the accident happened,
the mountains came down quite close to the sea,
so that they were crowded in much closer than
they had been. The nearness of the water made
the big chestnut restless and hard to handle.</p>

<p>The Spaniard had great difficulty in getting
near enough to his horse to get hold of his hind
foot. When he did succeed in doing this, and
was just starting to peg the shoe on, an extra big
wave slapped down upon the beach, though at a
safe distance and caused the big chestnut to jump
and hurl his master to a distance of a dozen feet.</p>

<p>"This won't do," cried Jim. "I'll take my horse
around to the sea side of yours and close up. Perhaps
that will give your animal confidence."</p>

<p>It worked like a charm, for though Caliente was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
high-spirited, he was not flighty and he steadied
his comrade so that the two workers were able to
fasten the shoe.</p>

<p>"We have lost a good half hour," said Jim, looking
at his watch with a grave face.</p>

<p>"Perhaps we shall have to turn back," remarked
the Spaniard with gravity. "We may not escape
the incoming tide if we go on."</p>

<p>"Don't you believe it," cried Jim, impetuously.
"I've got business ahead and must go."</p>

<p>"Have it your way," said the Spaniard with a
peculiar smile. He knew what dangers lay ahead
with a rising tide and Jim did not or he probably
would not have been so insistent.</p>

<p>"I see no sign of Jo," remarked Jim, as they
swung into the saddles.</p>

<p>"Ah, we will not catch him. He is safe," replied
the Spaniard.</p>

<p>Then with tremendous speed, they swept down
the beach, the splendid horses responding to the
crisis. It was their fleetness against the steadily
rising rush of the inexorable sea. They actually
gained ten minutes on the first two miles and a
half. Then Jim saw ahead the dark form of a
headland thrusting out towards the sea.</p>

<p>Already the rush of a long wave would send the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
water lapping around their horses' feet. Jim
recognized the danger. They must get around
that promontory or give up beaten. Then he gave
Caliente a touch with a spur, the first that day.
With a snort, the spirited animal sprang forward
faster than before and at his shoulder was the
chestnut with flaming nostril.</p>

<p>None too soon had they reached the headland,
for the recurrent waves were beginning to surge
against it, with full force and gnawing foam. In
the fierce fury of their charge, they sent their
horses against the sea. It was at the long withdrawal
that made bare the scattered black rocks,
that they rounded the headland.</p>

<p>But too soon a great thundering wave with the
force of the Pacific behind it came roaring in
and swelled to the horses' throats, almost submerging
the riders. But the animals held against
its withdrawing power and before the ocean could
return to the attack, they had got beyond the headland
to a safe place on the beach.</p>

<p>The horses were trembling and quivering with
their exertions and with the fear of the sea
which is the most terrible and paralyzing of
all fears. Jim drew a long breath of relief and
looked ahead to see if there was any sign of Jo.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
Then to his consternation he saw that the beach
curved inland and at the further end of the curve
was another frowning headland thrusting itself
out somewhat further than the one they had but
just rounded.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<h3>THE ENCHANTED ISLE</h3>


<p>Let us now return to the Sea Eagle, and find out
what is happening there.</p>

<p>You recollect that Juarez had just discovered two
islands lying on the South-eastern horizon, the one,
long and low, the other comparatively short and
dumpy. He had been conversing with the tall shepherd
of the island, who seemed to take an interest in
Juarez. But because of his isolated life during a
greater part of the year, he would have taken an
interest in a stone idol, if he had chanced to discover
one.</p>

<p>"Which of these islands are we making for?" inquired
Juarez.</p>

<p>"The one where we land," replied the sheep farmer
oracularly. "I might ask the Cap'n, only I never
pester him with questions. You aren't a Yankee,
are you?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Juarez, "I'm not. My folks live in
Western Kansas."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm glad to hear it, son. But what are you doing
here?" he asked.</p>

<p>"You aren't a Yankee, are you?" inquired Juarez,
quizzically. The man laughed softly to himself.</p>

<p>"You've got me there, lad," he said. "It looks to
me," he continued, "that the old man is going to
steer for the further island."</p>

<p>"Then you will have to swim for your home," remarked
Juarez.</p>

<p>"I can wade," he replied whimsically, looking
down at his long legs.</p>

<p>"You are a humorist," said Juarez.</p>

<p>"No, you can put me down for a philosopher,
that is to say, a man who has much time to think
and nothing to do."</p>

<p>"I should like to be one," said Juarez. "Suppose
you holy-stone these decks while I try it."</p>

<p>"No, my friend," replied the shepherd, "I am too
much of a philosopher to make any such swap."</p>

<p>"Is Captain Broom one?" asked Juarez.</p>

<p>"Well, he is a sort of a philosopher till he gets
mad, then he becomes a living active volcano, belching
out a lava of hot language and scorching things
generally. I guess that I had better be moving along.
I see that he is eyeing me from the Bridge, and he is
likely to get active any moment if I keep you from
working." With this the lanky shepherd strolled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
forward and seating himself upon the top of the
boys' sleeping place in the bow, smoked his pipe in
meditative comfort.</p>

<p>His estimate in regard to the destination of the
Sea Eagle proved to be correct. For in the early
afternoon the ship passed under the lee of the long
island and was steaming up the channel between it
and the mainland, which was distant some thirty-five
miles.</p>

<p>The fog had cleared by noon, and there was that
complete transition to brilliant, sunny weather.
There was a sort of a white haze along the distant
coast and beyond far inland, rose the faint summits
of the high mountains.</p>

<p>Fortunately Juarez and Tom had a chance to
observe their new surroundings for they had been
set to work sewing on a small sail that was to be
used in one of the boats. They sat upon the top of
one of the hatches, under the watchful eyes of old
Pete and the philosophic gaze of the shepherd.
Sewing was one of the accomplishments of the
Frontier Boys. They had been obliged to learn.</p>

<p>"What is that particular bronze looking weed,
floating in these waters?" asked Tom. It was as
Tom phrased it, bronze and a most beautiful color.</p>

<p>It was indeed a giant among weeds; just such as
the garden of the ocean would grow. The stems<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
were fifty to eighty feet long, with peculiar colored
leaves eight to ten inches in length, growing on little
boughs from the parent stem. The whole structure
was held up by small bronze buoys, of a round shape.</p>

<p>"Well as ye seem likely boys and want to learn,
I'll tell you about this plant," said the shepherd.
"The scientific fellows call it Algae. When the
world was first made this algae covered the whole
surface of the ocean."</p>

<p>"How did you learn this?" asked Juarez.</p>

<p>"You know that the Captain is quite a collector,
and in his travels has gotten together among many
other things some interesting books. He gives them
to me when convenient." The face of the lanky
shepherd was perfectly grave when he spoke of
Captain Broom as a collector.</p>

<p>"What makes the water so clear around here?"
asked Juarez. "I never saw anything like it."</p>

<p>"Well, you see," replied their mentor, "this island
is placed peculiarly, I mean this side of it. You
see how quiet the water is?"</p>

<p>"It is certainly smooth and blue," said Juarez.
"More like a lake than the ocean."</p>

<p>"That's only true of this side," resumed the
shepherd, "the other is rough enough, but you see
the prevailing winds are from the Northwest and
this shore is never disturbed. So on the beaches<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
you will find not sand, but smooth round pebbles,
because there is no action of the water, no breakers
or waves to grind them into sand."</p>

<p>About four o'clock the Sea Eagle came into a perfectly
beautiful little harbor, at the South-eastern
end of the island. There was a small level plot
back from the beach and on all sides rose steep hills
and back of them the mountains. It was the most
picturesque scene the boys had ever beheld in all
their travels.</p>

<p>What would they not have given to have been free
to roam that island, hunting inland, or fishing or
bathing along those quiet, enchanted shores. But this
was no pleasure excursion. Far from it. Captain
Broom had his own ideas, and he did not intend
to make a landing at all.</p>

<p>"Get the whale boat ready, lads!" he ordered.
"And put her over, we've got no time to lose."</p>

<p>They lost no time either, under Captain Broom's
commanding eye.</p>

<p>What was necessary for the cruise was already in
the boat. Two casks of water, several guns, and a
lot of provisions. Then the boat was hove overboard
into the quiet bay. The captain was ready
with a much battered satchel in his hand. Not for
one second did he entrust it to any one else.</p>

<p>"Now over with you, you two lads," he com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>manded
and Juarez and Tom, with a sinking of the
heart, got into the boat. This was the last leg of their
mysterious journey, and it boded them no good
they felt sure of that. The mate they noticed stayed
aboard in charge of the ship.</p>

<p>They were put in the stern where old Pete had the
steering oar. Near them sat the shepherd on one of
the casks of water, his long legs getting uncertain
accommodation. The captain had his position in the
bow and two powerful sailors were at the oars, one
on either side. They did not sit down, but stood up
to their work.</p>

<p>Without any loss of time the boat got under way
proceeding seaward from the shelter of the beautiful
little harbor. In spite of their depression, the two
boys could not help being interested in the absolutely
clear water in which they could look down for
eighty feet.</p>

<p>They could see the straight slender columns of the
Algae rising to the surface, starting from where
they were rooted in the bottom of the bay and swaying
to the slow pulsation of the tide. These strange
plants of this marine garden were marvels indeed.
Between their stalks and among the encrusted rocks
swam in absolute unconsciousness of being watched,
many beautiful, and strange fishes.</p>

<p>Some were small of golden hue, with little spots<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
of a marvelous blue (poetry) that flashed like keen
electric dew, (that will do). Others were like gold
fishes, a foot in length and of corresponding
breadth. There were long mackerel, and innumerable
minnows, and over the rocks a peculiar little
fish crawled or rather walked on thin rat-like feet.</p>

<p>Before they had time to observe further the boat
had got out of the harbor where the water sunk away
to blue unfathomed depth. When clear of the harbor,
they turned to the South, passing near a cove
with a symmetrical pebbly beach, built up for five
feet, above the level of the water. The ocean was
perfectly smooth, with not a ripple upon its surface.
They were evidently making to round the Southern
extremity of the Island.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<h3>IN THE WHITE BOAT</h3>


<p>Ahead of them was a rock rising fifty or sixty
feet out of the water. It was evident that the rock
was inhabited for there could be seen dark forms
moving around upon it. Nothing had been said
since they started, for the Captain was not in a
talkative mood. Jeems Howell, the shepherd, had
sat silently smoking his pipe in philosophic contentment.</p>

<p>"What are those things on that rock?" inquired
Tom, his curiosity getting the best of his reserve.</p>

<p>"Two yankees in this boat," commented the
shepherd. "Those are seals, son. Didn't you ever
see any before?"</p>

<p>"No!" admitted Tom.</p>

<p>"You didn't know that seals, next to humans, are
the smartest animals, in the world."</p>

<p>"Is that so?" inquired Juarez. "They certainly
are sleek."</p>

<p>"They have got the most brain room, that's a
fact."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>The boys regarded the seals with peculiar interest
as the boat passed near the rock. They were moving
about awkwardly by means of their flippers, moving
their sinuous necks this way and that and regarding
the strange boat with their soft brown eyes.
Then they dived headlong into the sea, swimming
about with a peculiar grace.</p>

<p>"Queer animals," remarked Tom, "belong half to
the sea and half to the land."</p>

<p>"Something like sailors," remarked the shepherd.</p>

<p>"What's the Captain going to do with us?" asked
Juarez in a low voice. The shepherd's face took on
a solemn expression, but before he could reply the
Captain's voice roared.</p>

<p>"None of that, you'll find out soon enough. You
can talk about the flory and fauny, with long shanks,
but don't let me hear anything else out of you," such
was the Captain's ultimatum.</p>

<p>But soon matters grew so interesting that they lost
all inclination for talking. When they got near the
Southern end of the island they began to notice
white caps to the Southward, dotting the darkness
of the sea.</p>

<p>"You lads will have to hold tight now in a few
minutes," remarked Howell. "Do you get seasick?"</p>

<p>"No," replied the boys.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, you will have a chance soon, and if it don't
fetch you, nothing will."</p>

<p>So far they had been rowing under the sheltering
lee of the island whose huge rocky bulk had shouldered
off the charge of the wind-driven seas. Now
before they had fairly rounded the island the character
of the water began to change. The boat began to
toss on the great rollers. Then as they cleared the
land for good and were in the channel, a fresh gust
of wind struck them, drenching the occupants of the
boat with spray.</p>

<p>The Captain stood up in the bow of the boat and
steadying himself took in the conditions of the sea
and wind. There was nothing in his grim weatherbeaten
face to show what he felt. The men at the
oars now made hard work of it against the headwind
and the running sea.</p>

<p>They would climb up a steep wave and then with
a sickening slide, go down into the hollow, then with
a lusty pull the sailors would bring the heavy boat
over the toppling crest of wave to find another rushing
to meet them. No rest, this was what made it
such heart breaking work.</p>

<p>The early fog had come, covering the sea with
gloom, and the waves did not go down perceptibly.
At times, they shipped a good deal of water and
Tom and Juarez were kept busy bailing out. After<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
an hour's hard struggle the sailors were about all
in and seemed hardly able to hold their own against
the sea and wind. The Captain was quick to notice
this.</p>

<p>"Can you row, lad?" he inquired of Juarez. Now
the latter's experience had been confined to his work
going down the Grand Canyon of Colorado, on the
raft-boat that the Frontier Boys had built.</p>

<p>Even the old ocean itself could not show anything
worse than some of the rapids that the boys had run.
As for rocks, nothing could beat the canyon for
them.</p>

<p>"I'll try, sir," he replied, "I've never rowed on the
ocean."</p>

<p>"Humph!" grunted the Captain, "take the starboard.
And you, you lazy long shanks, you take the
other oar."</p>

<p>"All right, sir," replied cheerfully, the one addressed.</p>

<p>"Get out of here, Pete," he cried, giving that
worthy a lift with his foot that landed him on top of
Tom, "I'll do the steering. You boys will only have
to pull, that's all. I'll keep her headed up right."</p>

<p>Fortunately Juarez was in fine condition, or he
could never have stood the gruelling work ahead.
He weighed one hundred and sixty pounds and there
was not an ounce of fat on him. Likewise he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
had a sound night's sleep and three square meals
so that he was fortified for what was ahead.</p>

<p>Juarez buckled to the task with all his strength,
and he was glad of the chance to get his blood in
circulation for he was chilled to the bone by the flying
spray, and then too, anything was better than
thinking of the fate ahead. He was surprised to
find out that the shepherd who appeared rather
frail in physique was able to keep up the pace.</p>

<p>But he had that sinewy length of muscles that
counts for more than mere bunchy thickness.
Juarez was crafty enough not to spend all of his
strength in the first fifteen minutes of work. He
liked this, fighting the sea and standing on his feet
he was able to put the whole leverage of his body into
the stroke.</p>

<p>The change in speed was noticeable right away,
and the boat began to pull ahead steadily. The two
sailors who had been laid off from exhaustion, had
watched Juarez with a sneering grin as he took the
oar. They were sure that the first wave that came
along would wrench the oar out of his hand. Great
was their surprise when they saw him buckle to the
oar, rising and pulling at the right time to meet
the toppling, rustling seas.</p>

<p>"That little shrimp will last about ten minutes,"
said one of them to his mate.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sure, Bill," replied the other.</p>

<p>Juarez choked back a hot reply, for he knew that
it would not be good for him to say anything to them.
They were in the majority and would get him if he
did, besides making it bad for Tom. The ten minutes
passed and Juarez was just beginning to warm to
his work. This took the wind out of their sails
completely.</p>

<p>The powerful hand of the Skipper at the steering
oar was a great help, for now all that the two men
at the oars had to do was to pull and not to worry
about keeping her headed right. Juarez kept
steadily at it for an hour and then darkness began
to fall over the channel but not until the island that
they were approaching had begun to loom up, dead
ahead.</p>

<p>They were now getting in the lee of the strange
island and the sea was moderating perceptibly. At
this juncture the two sailors who had become
thoroughly rested took the oars from Juarez and his
co-worker and pulled steadily through the gathering
gloom. In a short time the bulk of the island
loomed above them in the darkness.</p>

<p>Not a word was said, only the swish of the sea
was heard and the groaning of the oars in the locks.
Tom and Juarez were deeply depressed and gloomy.
They felt exactly as though they were being taken<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
to prison and could sympathize with sailors who had
been marooned on lonely and desolate islands.</p>

<p>"Easy now, lads," called the Captain, as he brought
the boat's head squarely around towards the shore.</p>

<p>"Two strokes," he yelled, "and let her run."</p>

<p>With great force they pulled the oars in succession,
then they shipped them in a hurry. Juarez
could see the dashing of foam on either side of the
boat where the waves smote the rocks. There was a
roar in his ears as the boat rushed toward seeming
sure destruction. It was going with great speed
from the impetus of the sailors' strokes.</p>

<p>The Captain was standing taut at the steering
oars, his eyes piercing the darkness ahead, then the
foam of the breakers dashed in their faces, there
was a quick sliding past of dark rocks and before
they could draw breath again the boat was in quiet
water, under some black cliffs. At last they had
reached the mysterious goal of their mysterious
journey.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<h3>IN PERIL</h3>


<p>We must now go back in our narrative to where
we left Jim Darlington and the Spaniard, Senor
Sebastian, in a position of extreme peril, between
the cliffs and the deep sea, with the white-fanged
tide coming in like a devouring monster eager for
its prey.</p>

<p>"Is there a chance, Senor?" cried Jim as soon
as his horse gained his footing.</p>

<p>"It is the fatal day, I fear," replied the Spaniard
with resigned hopelessness. "The sea is hungry."</p>

<p>"As for that, so am I," declared Jim coolly. "So
let us try to get around the headland and after that,
supper."</p>

<p>"As you please," acquiesced the Spaniard quietly.</p>

<p>Then Jim turned Caliente's head and with a
quick touch of the spur sent him full stride along
the curving beach, followed closely by the Spaniard.
Already the heavy waves were licking far<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
up the slant of the sand. Even the veteran Caliente
seemed nervous at its approach, while Don
Fernando would jump and shy as the hissing water
crept around his feet.</p>

<p>In about two minutes the two horsemen reached
the base of the rocky headland that barred their
way. It was a desperate moment, there was
but one thing to do and that was to take the
chance.</p>

<p>"Better be drowned quick, Caliente, old boy,"
cried Jim, "than slowly, but we'll beat you yet,"
and he shook his clenched fist at the ocean, and
whirled his horse to meet a wave that struck
Caliente breast high. So for a moment, the two,
boy and horse, stood facing their powerful enemy,
The Sea, that came with the recurring charge,
its evenly separated files robed in blue with white
crests. Thus they stood getting a full free breath
before they leaped into the ranks of the foe.</p>

<p>Jim's strained, keen gaze took in every detail of
the situation, noting the position of the rocks that
a receding wave left bare, so that he might find a
clear path or trail in his dash for life. Nor did
his gaze flinch as he saw the advancing wave
break against the front of the cliff.</p>

<p>"Now, Caliente," yelled Jim, with a sense of
fierce determination and exultation that communi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>cated
itself to his horse, and lifting his feet free
from the stirrups so that he would not be entangled,
if Caliente should fall, he headed him
seaward, galloping fast down the beach upon the
heels of the withdrawing wave.</p>

<p>Meeting a smaller inrush of water and dashing
through its foaming crest, his gallant horse swam
until he got a foothold upon the rocks at the base
of the cliff. Now was the crucial moment. With
absolute recklessness, Jim urged his powerful
horse over the foam-covered rocks, striving to
get around the prow of the headland before the
charge of the next wave. Not one look did Jim
give seaward, all his energies were bent upon
using every precious second, and Caliente was
filled with his rider's indomitable spirit.</p>

<p>Then above them towered the fatal wave, and
with a confused roar, it broke over them in sweltering
foam and they were swept towards the
black front of the cliff. Then came the impact
against the rock and the next moment, stunned
and bruised, Jim holding to the pommel of the
saddle, with a death-grip, was carried out to sea
with Caliente in the grasp of the retreating wave.</p>

<p>It was all over, as like pieces of drift, horse
and rider were swept away, but fortune does
sometime favor the brave and, being caught in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
powerful current, Caliente was carried South of
the headland and his progress towards the sea was
stayed by a rock that rose high, an outer-guard of
the headland. So then the next great wave bore
them toward the beach, and once Caliente got his
feet upon the sandy bottom he braced himself
against the fierce pull of the retreating sea, striving
to drag him back again.</p>

<p>Though almost unconscious, Jim clung to the
saddle with his body half-drooping over the pommel.
Then Caliente plunged blindly forward until
he stood with head bent down and nose almost
touching the sand, his great sides heaving, but
safe at last.</p>

<p>In the distance, a horseman could be seen coming
at full gallop along the straight line of the
beach. It was Jo, who finally had become frightened
by the non-appearance of his two comrades
and had turned back. His fright had been increased
by seeing a horse and rider coming apparently
out of the sea.</p>

<p>When he came up, he found his brother Jim
sitting on the sand still half dazed but slowly coming
to himself.</p>

<p>"Where's the Senor, Jim?" cried Jo. This
question served to bring Jim completely to himself.
He got up, looking pale, with one side of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
his face bruised to a real blackness, and the flesh
of his left hand badly torn, where it had struck
the cliff, but he was not thinking of these matters.</p>

<p>"Why, Jo, the Senor came after me. Where is
he?" Then it came over him all at once, that his
companion was even now caught between the jaws
of the black cliff.</p>

<p>"We must get to him, Jo," he cried.</p>

<p>"But how did you ever get around that cliff?"
asked Jo.</p>

<p>Already it was an awesome sight as the waves
crashed in foam against its front and rushed shoreward
along its black sides. It seemed impossible
that only fifteen minutes before Jim had actually
come around that foaming headland.</p>

<p>In reply to Jo's question, Jim threw his arms
around Caliente's neck with warm affection.</p>

<p>"This is the old fellow that pulled me through,"
he cried. "But we must go to the help of our
Spanish friend."</p>

<p>"How can we?" inquired Jo. "We can't get
around the headland unless we become fishes."</p>

<p>Jim considered the problem carefully. One
thing he was determined on and that was not to
leave the Spaniard who had been so hospitable
and helpful to them.</p>

<p>"No, we can't go around by the headland," he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
determined, "but we might be able to find a way
over the rocks and down on the other side."</p>

<p>"All right, I'm ready."</p>

<p>"Let's find a place for Caliente first," advised
his owner. Back a short distance from the beach
there were some trees on a lower spur of the
mountain. Here Jim brought Caliente and took
off the saddle and bridle.</p>

<p>"Now make yourself comfortable," said Jim.</p>

<p>Caliente, in seeming recognition of what was
said, took immediate advantage of the invitation
and rolled heartily in a dry and dusty spot.</p>

<p>"Get your lasso, Jo," urged Jim, "and we will
start."</p>

<p>So together they made for the steep rock and
soon reached the base of it, and now began a hard
climb, but no more difficult than they had encountered
before in their travels.</p>

<p>"Do you recollect, Jim," inquired Jo, "that day
you got stalled in our first canyon in Colorado,
when you tried to imitate an eagle and fly up
a precipitous cliff and we had to get you
down?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I remember," replied Jim, "and how
I scared you and Tom by pretending that an Injun
was after me, when I went down to the creek
for water."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>"Poor Tom," said Jo sadly, "I wonder when we
will see him again."</p>

<p>"In a couple of days," stoutly declared the optimistic
Jim.</p>

<p>They were now going up the face of the cliff,
the lariats over their shoulders, and searching
with careful feet for a foothold, while their hands
clutched some piece of projecting rock.</p>

<p>"Lucky this rock isn't rotten," cried Jo, "or we
would find ourselves stuck headfirst in the sand
below."</p>

<p>"Like an ostrich," said Jim. "We couldn't do
much in a place like this without our moccasins,
that's certain."</p>

<p>The moccasins did make them nimble as goats,
and they not only made possible a secure hold,
but they protected as well the feet. At first they
were not in any grave danger of a fall because the
drifted sand at the bottom of the cliff would have
made a soft landing. But after a while they were
forced to work their way out over the rushing water,
then if they had slipped and fallen it would
have been all up with them.</p>

<p>It seemed as if the sea, furious at having lost
Jim a short while ago, was making fierce efforts
to get at them now. The great waves foamed
against the cliff and the spray dashed over the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
boys, making the surface of the rock treacherous
and slippery.</p>

<p>"I can't bear to look down," said Jo. "It makes
me dizzy."</p>

<p>"Look up, then," Jim called back.</p>

<p>"That's almost as bad," replied Jo.</p>

<p>"Keep 'em shut then," was Jim's command.</p>

<p>Finally they came to a place that stopped Jo entirely.
Jim was able to get over it, because of his
superior height and reach, and he attained a point
of safety above Jo.</p>

<p>"What am I going to do now?" cried Jo. "I
can't go any higher and it is impossible for me to
go back."</p>

<p>"You wait," urged Jim, "till I get a secure foothold
above here."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll wait," said Jo grimly, "you don't observe
any anxiety on my part to move, do you?"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<h3>TWO LASSOES</h3>


<p>Finally Jim reached a broad ledge, that gave
him an excellent foothold, and he got his lariat
ready and dangled the loop under Jo's nose.</p>

<p>"What are you going to hang me for?" inquired
Jo.</p>

<p>"For a horse thief, I reckon," replied Jim, "that
bay don't belong to you does it, Mister?"</p>

<p>"Meaning this ocean bay?" queried Jo.</p>

<p>"I certainly will hang you for that," retorted
Jim, "Now get the loop under your armpits."</p>

<p>"All ready," cried Jo.</p>

<p>Then Jim, bracing himself, kept a taut line on
his brother, and with this help he was able quite
easily to get over the slippery, bare belt of rock,
and in a few moments was safe with Jim on the
ledge.</p>

<p>"It won't take us long now," said Jo, "to get
to the other side."</p>

<p>"Let's give him a yell," suggested Jim, "to let
him know that we are coming."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Jim put his hands to his lips and cried:</p>

<p>"Senor, ahoy." They listened breathlessly and
in a few moments came a faint reply. This put
renewed energy into the boys and as the way was
now easier, they leaped ahead, agile as goats, and
had soon reached the top of the cliff. They looked
eagerly down.</p>

<p>There was the deep short semi-circle of the
little bay with the waves heaving in against the
cliffs and at the point midway between the two
head-lands, where the beach was highest, they saw
the Spaniard on Don Fernando. Already the encroaching
waves were gnawing at them.</p>

<p>It was only a question of minutes now, and
horse and rider would be carried out to sea. The
Spaniard sat like a statute. It was seemingly possible
for him to have made his escape up the cliffs,
which were not overly precipitous, like those Jim
and Jo had just scaled, but he was a fatalist and
believed that his day had come. Perhaps he did
not want to abandon his horse, in which his pride
was centered.</p>

<p>"Cheer up, Senor, we'll be there," yelled Jim.</p>

<p>Then followed by Jo, he sprang forward, leaping
from rock to rock, and from jutting point to
opportune foothold. It was dangerous and daring
work, but the life of their friend was at stake and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
the boys were not the kind to consider their own
safety at such a time.</p>

<p>It was only their sure-footedness and varied experience
in climbing that saved them from broken
limbs or possible death. In a remarkably short
time, they stood upon a ledge above the Spaniard.</p>

<p>"Here, Senor," yelled Jim, "catch the rope."</p>

<p>He did as ordered but called up, "Is there no
way to save my horse?"</p>

<p>Jim considered a moment, then shouted: "All
right, yes, we will save your horse, too. Tie the
ends of the lasso to the iron rings at the ends of the
front cinch." This was a broad, strong band,
which would furnish a good purchase, when Jim
tossed down the lariat. The Spaniard caught it
and made it fast as ordered.</p>

<p>"Now, fasten this under your arms," ordered
Jim, as he cast down the second lariat, which belonged
to Jo. They then drew up the Spaniard to
safety and he appeared to be pleased in a quiet way
but not at all enthusiastic.</p>

<p>"I am your eternal debtor, Senors," he said with
a courteous bow.</p>

<p>"How was it you did not follow me, Senor?"
questioned Jim, "when I sailed around the headland?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don Fernando balked," replied the Senor. "I
thought, too, that you had been drowned."</p>

<p>"Came near it," replied Jim. "I would, too, if
it had not been for Caliente."</p>

<p>"But my poor Fernando, he will be drowned,"
cried the Spaniard, now much more excited about
the safety of his steed than he had been for his
own. It did look rather bad for the big chestnut,
as a large wave swelling in, almost took him off
his feet. He began to neigh wildly.</p>

<p>"Don't worry, Don, old boy," cried Jim to the
frightened horse. "If you will help yourself."
There was something in his voice that seemed to
reassure the animal.</p>

<p>"Now, Jo, we will let you down by the lariat
and get the bridle reins over his head and help
him get a foothold on that ledge below us. He
will be safe enough there, even if he does get
somewhat damp."</p>

<p>"Let me go. It is my risk for my horse," urged
the Spaniard.</p>

<p>"It is no risk, Senor," replied Jim. "You are
heavier than my brother and stronger and can do
more good on this ledge with me."</p>

<p>"The commands of the General!" said the Spaniard
with a low bow. "I see your plan is good."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>"We will tie this end of the lasso to the tree,"
said Jim, "so you will feel perfectly safe, Jo."</p>

<p>The tree referred to was a sturdy, gnarled cedar,
growing on the ledge. Then Jim swung his
brother off and with every confidence in the
strength of the lariat to hold, Jo made his way
quickly and safely down, while if he had been
without the rope he would have doubtless fallen
into the water below.</p>

<p>A wave surged in, submerging him, and then
started triumphantly to carry him out to sea, but
when the lariat pulled taut Jo struggled safely
back on the rock, while the wave went grumbling
back.</p>

<p>"Catch the bridle now, Jo," urged Jim. "Don't
waste any more time swimming."</p>

<p>Thus adjured, Jo grabbed the bridle reins and
pulled them over Don Fernando's head, and braced
himself on the rock above. All was ready now,
and the two above held the loop of the lasso that
had been tied at the cinch, with both hands, and
they pulled together. Again a big wave swelled
in towards the cliff, which gave the frightened
horse a big boost.</p>

<p>Then, with Jim and the Spaniard pulling mightily
from the ledge above, and Jo giving the big
chestnut a purchase by a steady pull upon his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
bridle, the horse scrambled with a mighty clatter
and all his frightened energy up the sloping rock.
The lariat and Jo's work helped a whole lot.
Without the three, he would never have made it.</p>

<p>Before the next wave swept in, Don Fernando
stood, trembling and dripping, but safe, upon the
lower ledge. He seemed above the danger point
now, though an unusually big wave welled up
around the horse's fetlocks and the spray was continually
dashing upwards.</p>

<p>"He is all right now," cried Jim, "better come
up, Jo, where it is dryer."</p>

<p>"Haul in then," replied Jo, and then he was
landed safely on the ledge.</p>

<p>"Caught a speckled trout," exclaimed Jim in
happy humor again.</p>

<p>"Referring to my freckles, I suppose," grinned
Jo. "If I'm a fish, I reckon Don Fernando is a
whale."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose he is safe?" inquired the Spaniard
anxiously.</p>

<p>"Who, Jo?"</p>

<p>"Ah, no," said the Spaniard smilingly. "I mean
the Don. The water seems to be rising."</p>

<p>"You may rest assured that he is safe," replied
Jim. "It is the turn of the tide now, and it is only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
a westerly wind that makes it appear higher. All
we will have to do now is to wait."</p>

<p>"It is a great pity, this delay," said the Spaniard
warmly. "You are anxious to be on to the
rescue of your brother and his friend. Anyway,
I hope you will succeed as well in their case as
you did in mine."</p>

<p>"In another hour we will be able to start," said
Jim, "the tide will then commence to run out."</p>

<p>"Where shall we stop tonight?" inquired Jo.</p>

<p>"Camp in the open as usual," replied Jim.</p>

<p>"I hope we will get up above the sea so high
that it won't come within a mile of us," said Jo,
fervently.</p>

<p>"As to a place to stop, I will see to that," said
the Spaniard. "Do not give yourselves any uneasiness
on that score."</p>

<p>"It's getting kind of chilly roosting up here,"
remarked Jo, plaintively, "especially as the fog is
coming in."</p>

<p>"I'll warm you," said Jim. "Put up your
Dukes."</p>

<p>"You'll take the counts if I put up my Dukes,"
said Jo, who was an inveterate punnist.</p>

<p>"Shut up," yelled Jim, giving his brother a
hearty chug in the chest. Then they went at it
hammer and tongs, giving and receiving good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
hard blows, and after ten minutes of whaling at
each other, both were plenty warm. The Spaniard
looked on in mild wonder.</p>

<p>"You Americans love the hard exercise," he
said. "I should think you would have great pleasure
in resting awhile."</p>

<p>"I got the best of the bout," declared Jo. "See
how black and blue your face is on this side."</p>

<p>"You didn't do that," protested Jim. "That
was a wallop that old Neptune handed me when he
bumped my head against yonder cliff."</p>

<p>"Neptune! Yonder cliff!" jeered Jo. "You
ought to be a story writer and use fine words."</p>

<p>"Me a story writer!" growled Jim. "I <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'aint'">ain't</ins> got
so low as that, not so long as I have got two hands
to steal chickens with."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<h3>ANOTHER FRIEND</h3>


<p>"Do you not think, Senor Darlington, that it is
now safe to start?" inquired the Spaniard, who was
fearful of bloodshed, not quite understanding the
boys.</p>

<p>"Certainly," responded Jim, "we will get Don
Fernando down from his perch and proceed."</p>

<p>This proved to be an easier task than getting him
up. His master lowered by the rope to his side, one
scrambling leap and the horse was on the firm wet
sand of the beach, almost knocking his master over
in his eagerness to be on safe footing again. Don
Sebastian now showed the gay side of his nature, as
he vaulted into the saddle.</p>

<p>He swung his hat wildly, the blood mounting to
his face, and the horse seemed to feel the sting and
excitement of his master's mood, as he pranced,
danced and caracoled upon the sand and ended up
by bowing in unison with his master to the two
American lads, who were looking on with interest
and amusement.</p>

<p>Then the party made their way quickly along the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
curve of the beach and went around the fateful
headland with perfect safety, while quite a distance
out among the hidden rocks snarled the defeated
ocean. Then Caliente heard them coming and he
quickly raised his head, neighing in welcome to Jim
and his comrade, Don Fernando.</p>

<p>Jim gave him a vigorous hug for more than ever
he was fond of his faithful horse. In a few minutes
he had him saddled and away the three horsemen
thudded in a swift gallop down the beach. The
horses fairly flew, the wind of their speed tossing
their manes back. It was cool beneath the fog
laden sky and the refreshing sea air seemed to
give the horses tireless endurance.</p>

<p>Soon three miles had spun backwards under their
hoofs and the boys were filled with the joyous excitement
of the run. It seemed now that every stride
of the horses was bringing them nearer to the
hoped-for rescue of Tom and Juarez. And this was
an incentive to their energy.</p>

<p>"Here, friends, is where we branch off from the
beach," cried the Spaniard.</p>

<p>Then he turned his horse to the left and headed
straight for a wooded spur that extended from the
range to the shore. In a short time the three came
to a well-traveled trail and were soon riding through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
the semi-dusk of the woods. For two miles they
went up a steady grade.</p>

<p>Then they rounded the summit of the wooded
ridge and saw stretching far below them in the indistinct
dusk, a wide plain bounded on the West by
the blue darkness of the level sea with its rim of
yellow sand.</p>

<p>"We will soon be at the home of my friend, Senor
Valdez," said the Spaniard, "where we will spend
the night."</p>

<p>"I'm a lovely looking object to present itself in a
civilized home," protested Jim, "I look like a tough
who has been in a bar-room rush."</p>

<p>"You are my brave friend," said Senor Sebastian,
quietly, "and will be welcome."</p>

<p>Jim blushed, at least one side of his face did, the
other was already too deeply colored to show any
emotion, and he grinned sheepishly. Before he had
time to reply they swept into an open driveway,
carefully sanded, and drew rein in front of a long,
low white adobe house, that from its mountain terrace
looked over Plain and Sea.</p>

<p>Out came Senor Valdez to receive them, a stately
Spaniard, who furnished the boys with an ideal of
perfect courtesy ever after. To the end of their
days they remembered their first visit to the home
of Senor Valdez. How they did enjoy their dinner<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
that evening in the long, pleasantly lighted dining-room.</p>

<p>It was an excellent meal, with delicious soup, a
salad garnished with peppers of the Spanish style,
and garlic. Jim and Jo had never tasted anything
equal to it. Besides there were frijoles and lamb,
while the dessert was some slight and delicate confection
of jelly and cream, made by the hands of
the Senora Valdez.</p>

<p>"I feel wicked sitting here and eating this fine
meal," said Jo, addressing Jim in a low voice,
"when Tom and Juarez are being ill used and probably
starved."</p>

<p>"Well," replied Jim, who was always practical,
"I think it is better to eat, and to keep my strength
up."</p>

<p>"I guess it won't fail," commented Jo slyly.</p>

<p>The boys bore themselves well, and without any
diffidence though Jim had a whimsical recollection
of his bruised side face and blackened eye, and he
tried to keep it turned from the Senora Valdez, the
fragile little woman who sat at the end of the table
opposite her husband. She had snow white hair,
parted low over her ears and the pallid face was
lined with years. Very gentle was the Senora Valdez,
but she had in her time beheld scenes of car<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>nage
and terror, so Jim need not have worried
about his bruised face. But the wise old lady
noticed his solicitude and understanding, was the
more gracious to the young Americano because
of it.</p>

<p>That evening they sat on the piazza, that looked
out towards the sea, the Spaniards smoking and
Jim and Jo enjoying the music of a guitar played
by a Mexican in a dim corner of the verandah and
the boys heard a bit of important news.</p>

<p>"There was a mysterious ship put into shore
several miles South of here, late last night, Senor,"
said their host, "one of my shepherds brought me
word."</p>

<p>"The first scent of the trail," cried Jim eagerly.
Then the Senor Sebastian explained to his friend
more fully the objects of their search. Immediately
the listener was deeply interested. Then he sent for
an Indian, one of his trusted men, to come to him,
and gave him minute instructions about some matters.
Without a word the Indian turned and disappeared
in the darkness, and in a short time there
came the sound of a horse galloping full speed down
the road.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow, Senor Darlington, this Indian will
meet you at a point near the Puebla de los Angeles,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
which my friend knows and he will have all the information
there is obtainable as to the location of
this ship and its crew," thus spoke the Senor Valdez.
Jim thanked him with deep fervor for his unusual
kindness, but the Spaniard made light of it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

<h3>A TALE OF YORE</h3>


<p>As they sat there in the dusk of the verandah,
Jim would have liked to ask his host to relate
some of his experiences in southern California
for he felt sure that the Senor Valdez had
known something of adventure not only because
those early days were full of marvels of interest,
but there was something in the bearing of the
old Spaniard that spoke of former days of romance
and of stirring incidents.</p>

<p>Then, too, there was something in the after-dinner
content and quiet, following the perilous
adventure which they had been through that predisposed
the boys to listen to a good story of adventure.
Their friend, the Senor Sebastian, seemed
to divine what was passing through Jim's mind,
for he suddenly spoke, breaking the meditative
spell that had fallen upon the group on the piazza.</p>

<p>"It just occurred to me, Senor Valdez, that our
friends here might like to hear something of the
early days in this part of the country, for you of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
all men know it thoroughly and I am sure it would
interest them."</p>

<p>"Indeed, it would, Senor," cried Jim enthusiastically,
"it was in my mind to ask Senor Valdez to
tell us of the early days but I was afraid to impose
upon him."</p>

<p>"I feel greatly honored to think that you young
men would care to hear anything my poor tongue
could relate. It would hardly be worth your distinguished
attention." Jim made due allowance
for the courteous exaggeration characteristic of the
Spaniard.</p>

<p>"Try us, Senor," he said briefly, "we would
want nothing better."</p>

<p>"I will have the coffee brought first," replied
the Senor, "that may serve to stimulate my dull
imagination."</p>

<p>In a short time a softly moving servant brought
out a tray of coffee cups, and placed one before
each guest on a small wicker table. Jim noticed
these cups with immediate interest. They were
certainly beautiful and he had never seen anything
like them before. They were of a wonderful
blue, each one, and had a coat of arms
in gold with raised figures on it; a scroll above
with a Latin motto, and beneath the representation
of a wild animal couchant. The Senor Valdez was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
quick to see Jim's interest and respond to it. "That
is the coat of arms of my family," he explained.</p>

<p>"I am not a scholar, Senor," said Jim, "and
all I can make of the motto is that it has something
to do with a lion."</p>

<p>"You are quite right," the ghost of a smile
hovered around the white-fringed lips of the
Spaniard, at Jim's innate boyishness.</p>

<p>"That figure does not look exactly like a lion,"
remarked Jo frankly.</p>

<p>"Not like an African lion certainly," replied the
Spaniard, "but a lion nevertheless, such as one finds
yet in the mountain fastnesses of Spain, something
like a panther only larger and much more fierce."</p>

<p>"The lion seems to have a rope or chain around
his neck," commented Jim, "and fastened to a
collar."</p>

<p>"Quite so," responded the Spaniard, "likewise
the motto translated reads, 'Gentle as a Lion.'"</p>

<p>"Rather strange way of putting it," said Jim curiously.</p>

<p>"I will explain, for you would naturally be
puzzled by the phrase, 'Gentle as a Lion,' as it
seems to contradict common knowledge," said
Senor Valdez. "You see my family has the distinction,
if such it can be called, in these modern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
days, the distinction of being old. This coat-of-arms
dates back to the eleventh century."</p>

<p>Jo was about to give a prolonged whistle of surprise
when Jim gripped his knee to enforce silence,
for though Jo might mean all right, the Spaniard
might not understand.</p>

<p>"The founder of the family who flourished at
that time was a rather rugged character, and I am
afraid would regard the family representatives of
this day as very puny and unworthy specimens.
This Rodriquez de Valdez had his castle in a
rugged mountainous part of Spain, where there
were plenty of wild animals and of wilder and
fiercer men, bandits and free-booters without number.</p>

<p>"His castle was a very powerful one, not only
in construction but likewise in location, as it was
built on a shelf of rock above a deep chasm, with
precipitous cliffs behind it. However, Rodriquez
de Valdez spent but very little time behind the protection
of its powerful walls. It would take the
forces of some strong Duke from the lowland to
cause him to seek the shelter of his castle and to
raise his war banner of crimson with a blue cross
upon it, above the turret.</p>

<p>"He spent his days hunting among the mountains
for wild beasts or for marauding bands of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
lawless men. Rodriquez was a man of wonderful
strength, even for those days, when there were
giants in the land. In stature six feet five and
powerful in proportion and likewise very fleet of
foot. If I should tell you of some of the legends
of his strength and swiftness, you would probably
laugh.</p>

<p>"But the one that has to do with the coat-of-arms
of my family I will tell you. It chanced one day
that he was out in the wilds of the mountains
and quite alone. Intent upon the trail of a deer
that he was following along a shelving mountain
side, he did not see a lion half grown, but nevertheless
very dangerous, which was crouching on
the branch of a tree ready to spring upon him when
he got beneath it.</p>

<p>"When he had passed by under the tree a pace
or two, the lion sprang with distended claws.
Some instinct of danger made Rodriquez turn and
he was just in time to grapple with the brute,
clutching it by the throat. The lion had some
advantage in weight but not a great deal, for my
brave ancestor was probably three hundred pounds
of sinew, bone and muscle. So that the struggle
was not such an unequal one, but it was terrific
while it did last. Finally, though torn and bleed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>ing,
the man subdued the beast, and had it in abject
fear of him.</p>

<p>"Then instead of killing the lion as one would
naturally expect, Rodriquez took a strange humorous
notion into his head. He would make a pet of
this same lion and it should be his dog to follow
obediently at its master's heels wherever he went.
This idea he carried out and he even had a heavy
brass collar placed upon its neck, and it followed
him on all his trips, slouching with padded tread
at his heel, or behind his war horse as he rode
abroad, like a powerful yellow dog.</p>

<p>"I do not imagine that the beast ever had any
great amount of affection for his master, but he
no doubt was in great fear of him, which seemed
to answer the purpose quite as well. So, my
friends, you have a full and complete explanation
of the coat-of-arms of my family. My only fear is
that I have wearied you with what could not have
the same interest for you as it does for me."</p>

<p>"Indeed, you have not wearied us, Senor," exclaimed
Jo enthusiastically.</p>

<p>"That is one of the most interesting accounts
that I have ever listened to," said Jim. "I only
wish I could have lived in those days when there
was plenty of adventure."</p>

<p>"I do not think that you have any reason to com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>plain,"
remarked the Spaniard laughingly. "Perhaps
your descendants in future years will be
pointing out your daring deeds as emblazoned on
their coat-of-arms."</p>

<p>"No danger of that, I guess," laughed Jim,
"though they might have a picture of Jo and me
tied to a mule. That was the way old Captain
Broom treated us." The Spaniard joined in the
merriment at this unheroic representation of Jo and
Jim.</p>

<p>"Now, Senor Valdez, you have told us a tale
of old Spain, tell us something of new Spain here
in California," urged Jo.</p>

<p>"It seems to me that it is now someone else's
turn," said the Senor. "I would not do all the
talking. A host should sometimes listen. Perhaps
Senor Darlington will tell us of some of his experiences.
They will be much more stirring than
any musty tales of mine." But Jim shook his head
firmly, not to say obstinately.</p>

<p>"I would not think of telling our adventures,"
he replied. "Perhaps after we have travelled more,
we will have something worth while relating."</p>

<p>"That's right," said Jo, "we would much rather
listen to you, Senor."</p>

<p>The Senor Valdez sipped slowly at his coffee,
looking out into the semi-darkness beyond the ve<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>randah,
where over the plain below stretched the
gray blanket of the fog-clouds. Then he rolled
another cigarette, lit it and took a few meditative
puffs. The Senor now began his next story at a
peculiar angle, and did not commence with the
stereotyped form of "once upon a time," so dear
to the days of one's childhood.</p>

<p>"I see you do not take cream in your coffee,"
he said addressing Jim.</p>

<p>"No, but I like some sugar, not too much."</p>

<p>"It has seemed to me," said the Spaniard, "that
the seasoning of coffee is in a way an indication
of character."</p>

<p>"Where the party uses milk in his coffee that
indicates weakness, does it not, Senor?" inquired
Jim with a sly look at Jo, but the subtle Spaniard
was not to be trapped.</p>

<p>"Not necessarily," he replied, "only mildness."</p>

<p>"And when it is taken straight and black that
means a strong character," remarked Jo.</p>

<p>"You have stated it," replied the Spaniard.</p>

<p>"But I would like to know how I would be sized
up?" questioned Jim, "you see I use a little sugar."</p>

<p>"My friend," said the Spaniard with playful
earnestness, putting his hand lightly on Jim's knee,
"that shows a character of great strength, tempered
with mercy and human kindness. All of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
which leads one to speak of a man who was once
famous in this part of the country, but not popular.
He always had the reputation for taking a strong
liquor in his coffee, Fernet, if I remember right.
His name was Alverado, but I judge that you are
not acquainted with it."</p>

<p>"No," replied Jim, "but I should say that he was
a very fierce character."</p>

<p>"He was. He was a bandit."</p>

<p>"I thought so," agreed Jim.</p>

<p>"This Don Alverado came from a well known
Spanish family, of ancient lineage, but impoverished
fortune. He was such a wild and unruly blade
that his family were decidedly relieved when he
left Spain and came to the new world to mend his
fortune, if not his ways. He landed first in Mexico,
and after a series of more or less remarkable adventures,
he came to this part of California. I
knew him, or rather I knew of his family in Spain,
and for their sake I made him welcome here at my
home.</p>

<p>"He was really a charming fellow in manner and
appearance, tall, slight, with dark eyes and hair, a
typical cavalier. But the graces of his manner did
not reach down to his heart, and after a disagreeable
episode which I need not revive here, he left
my rancho never to return except as an enemy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
I heard nothing further of him after his departure
for some six months. My next introduction to him
was an unpleasant one.</p>

<p>"It consisted in the loss of a band of horses and
a herd of cattle which were driven off by a gang
of raiders, thirteen in number, at the head of which
was this fellow Alverado. His depredations went
on for years among the ranchmen in this part of
California. So resourceful and crafty was this desperado
that he evaded trap after trap laid for his
capture.</p>

<p>"He had several very close calls and there were
numerous battles between the outlaws and the ranch
owners, but though some of his men were shot,
he seemed to bear a charmed life. I remember
one running fight over the plain yonder, when, believing
me to be absent from home, as I had been,
but returned unexpectedly from the north, this
Alverado and his gang made a bold dash to capture
some horses from a field directly below the house.</p>

<p>"It did not take long to get my men together
and I gave the bandits a surprise indeed. Nothing
but the speed of Alverado's horse, a splendid
black stallion, saved him from capture. We got
several of his men however. At last there came
the turning of the lane. Through the treachery of
one of the band we found that their rendezvous was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
at the head of a small canyon in a range of foot-hills
several miles south of here.</p>

<p>"You will go through it tomorrow on your way
south, if you carry out your speed schedule, which
with your remarkable horses you ought to be able
to. We came upon the gang about noon, where
they were resting after a long chase. In a corral
near by were a number of stolen stock. They
were not expecting trouble of any kind. Some
were playing cards, a few cooking, most, however,
were enjoying the siesta, their leader among the
number lay under the shadow of a tree, his head
resting on a saddle, sound asleep.</p>

<p>"There were fifty of us, and we had them surrounded,
so that there was no chance of escape.
Alverado himself made a desperate dash, but the
cordon was too strong. The rest surrendered.
That afternoon we took the bunch to the lower
end of the canyon, where there was a giant sycamore
tree. There we hanged the whole thirteen,
and by them no more were troubled not even by
their ghosts."</p>

<p>Jim and Jo expressed their appreciation of their
host's kindness in entertaining them as he truly
had done in relating his tales. Then they said
good night and went to their room.</p>

<p>That night the boys slept in a comfortable bed in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
a quaint old bedroom with roses nodding in at the
half open casement windows. By the light of the
candles they could see the strange old and carved
furniture and tired as they were how they did
sleep.</p>

<p>The next morning they started hours before daylight.
"I will be prepared to welcome more of you
in a few days," said the Senor Valdez, and the boys
thanked him heartily. Promising to return soon
they galloped away through the darkness.</p>

<p>All day they rode, hardly drawing rein at all. At
first through the foot-hills and then over the wide
plains. Jo had a fresh horse, a powerful black, as
his other mount could not stand the strain of the
long trip that meant three score and ten of miles before
evening.</p>

<p>Early in the afternoon they left the plain and rode
into the deep and rugged gorges of a mountain
chain, running East and West. Thence into a broad
valley leading South-easterly, and about four <span class="smcap">p. m.</span>
they turned directly South entering a Pass in the
Southern side of the valley, from which they
emerged on a plain. Where the trail left the Pass
stood a large <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'scycamore'">sycamore</ins> tree, when they reached it,
the Indian messenger rose from its shelter.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

<h3>A WONDERFUL LEAP</h3>


<p>Now without <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'hestitation'">hesitation</ins> we must take up the fortunes
or rather misfortunes of Tom and Juarez as
they landed in the darkness upon the mysterious
island, for our narrative presses to its conclusion.
Never did they feel more hopeless than on this occasion,
when they were going to a dubious and uncertain
fate.</p>

<p>"You boys come with me," called the Captain
gruffly.</p>

<p>"How about me, Cap'n?" asked Jeems Howell,
the lanky shepherd.</p>

<p>"What's your business?" inquired Captain Broom
briefly.</p>

<p>"Looking after the sheeps."</p>

<p>"Then attend to it," said the Captain grimly.</p>

<p>"Certainly, Cap'n," replied the shepherd, who was
incapable of taking offense.</p>

<p>"You come, Jake," called the Captain, to one of
the sailors, "and be quick about it, we haven't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
much time." Tom shivered, for in the gloom and
tired as he was he felt that his time too was
short.</p>

<p>Then with the Captain in the lead, carrying a
lantern, which was muffled in his great coat, they
started, the sailor bringing up the rear.</p>

<p>"Look out sharp, that these lads don't spring
something on you, Jake. They are a bad lot."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir," replied the sailor, "they'll have to
be quick to get the jump on me, sir."</p>

<p>"It's the Injun one's the worst. Don't let him
scalp you," warned the Captain jocosely.</p>

<p>"I'm no Indian," said Juarez, hoarsely and utterly
reckless of his fate, "I'm an American, and was
proud of it, till I found you were one, you cursed
yankee barnacle."</p>

<p>"Ho, ho, lad!" roared the Captain, "you won't
talk so tall in a few minutes. Nothing like a slow
fire for stewing the nonsense out of a fresh kid."</p>

<p>"How far is this cave of yours, you are taking us
to, old salt horse?" said Juarez insolently, and utterly
unwise.</p>

<p>This was too much for Captain Broom, and with
an imprecation he turned to strike Juarez. This
was what Juarez was looking for and as the furious
Skipper whirled facing him, Juarez dodged his huge
fist, and sent a fierce hook to the Captain's jaw.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
There was anger, desperation and strength behind
that blow and the Captain fell, striking his head on
a rock. That time the Frontier Boys scored.</p>

<p>"Follow me, Tom," yelled Juarez, and he sprang
away through the darkness. It seemed like a hopeless
undertaking to make an escape with the sea on
one side and the cliffs on the other, and a desperate
enemy near at hand. But Juarez thought it
was best to take a chance. Anything was better
than captivity, that was seemingly just ahead of
them.</p>

<p>One thing he was determined on and that was,
that he would not be taken alive. He ran splashing
through the water, leaping rocks, with the two
sailors in fast pursuit. Not far ahead to the right
was the white dash of the breakers that shut off
escape in that direction, to the left was the cliffs.</p>

<p>Then before him rose a steep but not precipitous
rock that had been divided from the main cliff by
the action of the water. Instantly Juarez abandoned
his desperate plan of plunging into the sea,
and without lessening his speed, he sprang up the
rock, in his moccasined feet.</p>

<p>The sailor who was following most closely, got up
ten feet when he slipped and rolled violently to the
bottom, knocking down the one who came after.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
Once Juarez came near falling but he caught himself,
and kept going up, driven by a desperation that
seemed to carry him over every obstacle.</p>

<p>"We've got yer, ye little shrimp," exultantly
cried the sailors at the base of the rock, "Ye can't
get away unless you fly."</p>

<p>"Shoot the blasted little varmint," roared the Captain,
who, still dizzy, had struggled to his feet. In
obedience to the order a flash punctured the darkness
and there was a roar like artillery echoing
among the hollow cliffs. A slug of lead whistled
past Juarez's head.</p>

<p>The boy had now reached the top of the rock and
was at the crisis of his fate, a distance of ten feet
separated him from the main cliff, not an impossible
jump but the foothold was precarious and uncertain,
and fifty feet or more below were the jagged rocks,
and enemies equally as hard, but Juarez did not hesitate.</p>

<p>He dodged down just as the sailors fired another
shot, then he sprang to the narrow pinnacle of the
rock and bending slightly forward with bent knees
and swinging hand, poised for the leap.</p>

<p>"The condemned fool is going to jump," roared
the Captain. "Shoot him on the wing."</p>

<p>But the sailors were not ready and the skipper
ran between the rock and the cliff to be at hand to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
stamp the life out of Juarez when he should fall as
he knew he would. Then he leaped, a dark object
flying through space, his hands caught the edge of
the cliff, the roots of a small bush held him for a
moment, then he slipped. Below him was certain
death.</p>

<p>Two strong hands caught his arms, and he was
drawn in safety to the cliff above. The Captain and
the two sailors watched in open mouthed
wonder, all they could see was the dim figure of
Juarez crawl in safety over the top of the cliff, but
they could not determine the means of his escape.</p>

<p>It struck a superstitious chord in their natures
and the skipper became moody and silent.</p>

<p>Juarez breathlessly followed the lanky figure of
the shepherd through the darkness, for it was no
other who had extended the rescuing hand. Hardly
a word was spoken, and they started off. After going
a considerable distance they came to a slab hut built
at the foot of a high range of hills that formed the
backbone of the island.</p>

<p>Two shepherd dogs rushed forth and gave their
master a boisterous welcome, and were soon good
friends with Juarez. Everything in the hut was
neat; with Indian rugs on the floor which gave a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
warm touch of color to the interior and one side of
the hut was lined with books.</p>

<p>"What am I thinking of," suddenly cried Juarez
in dismay, "to leave Tom in the hands of that crew?
My head is wrong." With that, he grew pale and
slid unconscious to the floor. He had evidently not
recovered from the blow that the Mexican had dealt
him a few days before, and the strain he had been
under brought on a relapse. The shepherd worked
over him a long time before he finally brought him
around.</p>

<p>Meanwhile what had become of Tom? He had
not been quick enough to make his escape, and his
fate was in the balance when the Skipper came up
to him just after Juarez had disappeared over the
cliff.</p>

<p>"You don't get away, I promise you that, lad,"
growled the Captain. Roughly seizing the boy by
the shoulder he dragged him toward the cliff. Then
the two disappeared into the entrance of a cave, the
Captain still holding in one hand his battered leather
satchel.</p>

<p>The sailor who stood on guard at the entrance,
saw just then the lights of a steamer that was just
entering the channel and he rushed into the cave,
called to the Captain, and in a few minutes that
worthy appeared. If he felt any alarm he showed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
none, but without any loss of time he assembled his
crew, got his boat free of land and rowed silently
out to sea. Whatever he had intended to do with
Tom, evidently passed from his mind, now awakened
to the solution of some other problem.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>

<h3>IN THE STRAIT</h3>


<p>As Juarez and Tom were under the kindly escort
of Captain Broom and his sailors in the whale
boat on their cruise to the mysterious island, Jo,
Jim and the Spaniard had stopped at an old sycamore
tree, where, as had been promised, the Indian
messenger was awaiting their coming.</p>

<p>"What news, Yaquis?" asked the Spaniard,
who knew the Indian well.</p>

<p>"I saw the boat by my own eyes," he replied,
"heading for the Big Island," pointing to the
South. "By her smoke she stopped in the Bow Harbor
near the lower end." So spoke the Indian,
standing straight and tall. He was a picturesque
sight with his coarse, black hair cut square and
long.</p>

<p>"The trail is getting warm," exclaimed Jim
eagerly. "Where can we get a boat?"</p>

<p>"There is a small boat at the Harbor of San
Pedro," replied the Spaniard, "that is the property
of a friend of mine. I doubt not we can have
the use of it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is now a little after six," said Jim. "How
far is it to the Harbor?"</p>

<p>"A dozen miles," replied the Indian.</p>

<p>"Is your horse too tired, Senor Sebastian,
to make it by eight?" The Spaniard's eyes
flashed.</p>

<p>"Senor, Don Fernando is never tired. Let us
start."</p>

<p>"We are ready," replied Jim. "Which is the
shortest cut?"</p>

<p>"I will guide you," was the Indian's response.</p>

<p>"He knows this country like the foot does the
shoe," assured the Spaniard.</p>

<p>Without more ado, the new guide took the lead
and they rode at a rapid gait in single file. At
first they went down a gentle grade for several
miles until they came to a perfectly level plain
that stretched in three directions to the sea. At
the end of the land was a perfectly rounded rise
like a huge long bolster.</p>

<p>The party of rescuers left the Puebla de los
Angeles several miles to the East, taking the
shortest way to the harbor. There was no let-up
to the speed, if anything, they seemed to be
going faster, with sweaty sides and shoulders, but
with unaffected stamina. The going was fine,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
over a springy turf and sometimes they tore
through wide belts of tall mustard.</p>

<p>Jo and Jim were in fine fettle as the end of the
journey came in sight and there was promise of
their coming to close quarters with the pirates and
possibly rescuing their oppressed brothers from
captivity. Then, too, the passage of the strait in
an open boat appealed to their sense of adventure.</p>

<p>About eight o'clock, they came to a ranch two
miles from the harbor, where Senor Sebastian had
a short talk with a man who owned the small boat
that had been referred to. He was perfectly
willing to lend them the boat and also sent a
Mexican servant to bring back their horses and
put them up in his stables. Not forgetting to
thank him for his great kindness to them, the boys
turned their horses' heads for the harbor, the last
lap of their long journey had begun.</p>

<p>In a half hour, they stood on the shore of a
long, narrow inlet, at a point where a craft was
moored. From a small boat-house, they got the
oars, the mast and the sail to be used if the wind
was right. Then they were ready to get aboard.
Jim looked at his watch. "It lacks ten minutes of
nine," he said.</p>

<p>Then they embarked. The boat was not a
mere row-boat, but was found to be of good size<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
and about equal to a whale boat. It was staunch,
too, and sea worthy. The mooring was cast off.
Jim was at the bow oar, and Jo at the one back of
him on the other side, while the Indian, Yaquis,
steered. The tide favored them as they glided
quickly between the banks, and they were not long
in reaching the channel.</p>

<p>At first, there was a slow, heavy swell, while in
the lee of the land, that did not bother the boys
but within a half hour they were in a choppy sea
with breaking crests, and now the real work for Jo
and Jim began. Fortunately, the Indian was a
most skillful oar, and he kept them from being
swamped. As yet there was no breeze to help
them.</p>

<p>"This is almost as good as running the Rapids
in the Grand Canyon," cried Jim joyously.</p>

<p>The boys were in fine fettle for their work, notwithstanding
their long day in the saddle, and they
buckled to it with a will, although wet through
with flying spray. They had enjoyed a good rest
the night before and after their long ride they
were glad to get the kinks out of their muscles.
They really made remarkably good headway
against the sea and the stoical Indian grunted
approval of their work. Ah, but it was fine, bat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>tling
with the waves through the darkness, while
the boat thrashed and beat its way ahead.</p>

<p>The boys stood to their oars and put all the
strength of their lithe young bodies into the stroke
and they seemed tireless. The Spaniard had made
himself comfortable in the bow, where, sheltered
by a short overhead deck, he was soon fast asleep.</p>

<p>"Wake me when it is time to be drowned," he
said. "I know it is my fate." Jim remembered
the Spaniard's melancholy of the day before, and
laughed heartily, as he promised.</p>

<p>"There are the lights of a vessel," cried Yaquis,
who, though silent, was ever on the watch.
"Ahead of us to the Southwest."</p>

<p>"You are right," said Jim. The lights were like
two faint, moving stars, one aloft and the other
below.</p>

<p>"That isn't the Pirate ship," declared Jo. "She
wouldn't be showing any light." After a while,
the lights of the vessel were suddenly eclipsed, but
by the dull light of the moon, now risen, the vessel's
bulk could still be made out.</p>

<p>"She has gone into the further straits," said Yaquis,
"between the two islands."</p>

<p>A gentle breeze sprang up, but blowing directly
toward them, it lent no aid. Before midnight,
the westerly breeze had died absolutely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
down, and in a not very long time, the sea followed
suit, leaving a long swell and the rowing became
much easier. Nothing occurred to break the
monotony for a while. There was the steady
grinding of the oars in the row-locks and the lapping
of the waves in the gloom, for the moon was
now obscured by clouds. Then, of a sudden, the
Indian called a halt.</p>

<p>"Do you hear footsteps?" inquired Jim, jocosely.</p>

<p>"A steamer coming, I hear her, no lights. Pull
hard." In a minute, even the boys could hear
the beat of her engines and saw the occasional
flare from her stacks, then a dark form took shape
through the night. They pulled lustily for they
knew their danger and who it was. How quickly
they would be run down, if discovered, and left to
drown in the wide strait, when Captain Broom
found out their identity. No wonder they pulled.</p>

<p>"Stop now, draw in your oars. Lie down,"
warned the Indian.</p>

<p>Not a hundred yards to the Eastward came The
Sea Eagle and she was on an even line with the
boat that lay a black patch on the dark water. If
Captain Broom was not on the Bridge they would
be safe.</p>

<p>"Boat ahoy," boomed out his voice.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>"Indian fishermen," cried Yaquis. "Stop, take
me ashore."</p>

<p>With a growl, the Captain sent his ship ahead,
paying no attention to the "Indian fisherman" in
distress. There was a gleam of white teeth as
the Indian smiled at the hearty congratulations of
the boys and their glee at his stratagem. Then
the Spaniard and Yaquis took the oars while Jim
steered and Jo slept.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>

<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>


<p>When morning came, they were but a few miles
from the Northern end of the longer Island and
the fog was over the whole sky. The sea was
glassy with a sullen glaze. Nowhere was there
sign of any steamer or ship. The Sea Eagle
had made good her escape.</p>

<p>"I wish we had a stiff breeze to help us along,"
said the Spaniard, who loved not manual labor, as
did the boys.</p>

<p>"It will come, the strong breeze, soon," said the
Indian.</p>

<p>"When we make the Island, what are we to do?"
asked Jo.</p>

<p>"Who can tell, maybe Tom and Juarez have been
taken along with the Skipper, instead of being
marooned."</p>

<p>"That's so," replied Jo, and gloom settled down
upon his spirits, heavier than the fog upon the
sea.</p>

<p>"We will keep after them," said the never de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>spondent
Jim, "even if we have to chase them
around the world."</p>

<p>The boat seemed to crawl so slowly along, and
the boys began to fret in their eagerness to find
out whether their comrades were on the island or
not, but they were not yet close enough to make
out any object upon its surface. Then from the
West there came a breeze rippling the glassy water.</p>

<p>"Up with the sail," cried Jim. "Here's where
we fly."</p>

<p>As the breeze strengthened to a wind, they went
towards the island at a clipping gait. When they
got within a half mile of the shore, they began to
look eagerly for some sign of a living being and
they were disappointed at first, but they drove
their boat along as near the shore as they dared.</p>

<p>"Say, did you hear that?" cried Jim in excitement.
"That was a rifle shot, or my name is
Dennis."</p>

<p>"Three men on the shore," said the Indian, imperturbably.</p>

<p>"I see them," cried Jo, "on that beach yonder.
I believe it is Tom and Juarez. Hurrah for the
Frontier Boys."</p>

<p>"It is they," declared Jim as they drew closer,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
"but how Tom has grown. He looks over six
feet."</p>

<p>"That isn't Tom," said Jo. "It's some one else.
The short one is Tom." Then he saw Jim grin
and realized that he had been kidded.</p>

<p>"If this wasn't my busy day," said Jo, "I'd give
you a punching for being so smart."</p>

<p>Five minutes later, the boat had grounded on
the pebbly beach and The Frontier Boys were
again united. There was a great jubilee for a
while with the Spaniard, the Indian, and the
lanky shepherd on the outskirts of the family celebration,
but in a short time they were all good
friends, each according to his different nature; the
Spaniard, suave and courteous, the Indian stolid,
but with his share in the general good-will, and
Jeems Howell, the shepherd, lankily humorous.</p>

<p>"We met our old friend Captain Broom in the
channel, boys," said Jim, "steaming along like the
Devil was after him."</p>

<p>"I'll give him reason to think so," growled
Juarez sullenly, "if I ever get on his trail."</p>

<p>The Indian, Yaquis, grunted approval, for there
seemed to be a bond of sympathy between him
and Juarez, as the reader can well understand.</p>

<p>"How far is that cave, Tom, where the old
codger left you?" inquired Jo.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>"Just around the bend," said Tom. "Here's the
rock where Juarez made his famous jump."</p>

<p>"How did you ever get up there?" asked Jo in
wonder, looking up at the pinnacle of rock.</p>

<p>"You'd a done the same if those fellows had
been chasing you," replied Juarez, "but if it
hadn't been for Jeems here catching me when I
jumped they would have got me after all."</p>

<p>"I was afeard you might have fallen on the
Skipper and a hurt him. He's a kind of a tender
plant you know." The Shepherd made this remark
with a perfectly sober face, in no wise disturbed
by the hilarity of the boys, over the idea
of the tenderness of the Skipper.</p>

<p>"Here's the cave," said Juarez, and he led the
way through an arched opening in the wall of the
cliff. Picking up a lantern, he went ahead as
guide.</p>

<p>"This is certainly a dry cave," said Jim.</p>

<p>"It ought to be," said Jeems Howell. "It don't
rain on this Island more than twice a year, but I
feel it in my bones that it is coming on to storm
today."</p>

<p>"I hope you don't feel it in <i>all</i> your bones," remarked
Jim, quizzically, "because it is liable to be
a long drawn out storm if you do."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>The lanky Shepherd gave himself over to
spasms of silent mirth at Jim's queer humor.</p>

<p>"Here's where we found Tom," said Juarez.
"Just discovered him a couple of hours before you
discovered us."</p>

<p>When the Captain had made his sudden change
of plans, Tom made himself as comfortable as he
could for the night, intending to search for Juarez
in the morning.</p>

<p>"Sometime I hope that this wretched Captain
will be captured and imprisoned right here," said
the Spaniard with a cold, vindictiveness.</p>

<p>"If he comes snooping around here again, that
is what will happen to him," remarked Jim quietly.
"I suppose, Tom, that he hid some of the loot he
took from us in this cave somewhere. I bet this
is his safe deposit vault, all right."</p>

<p>"He went back in there with his small satchel,"
said Tom, indicating the depths of the cave as yet
unexplored.</p>

<p>"It will keep," said Jim, "but before I leave this
island for Hawaii, I am going to search every corner
of this cave and see if I cannot find our property."</p>

<p>"We discovered it in a cave and perhaps we will
lose our treasure in a cave," said Juarez, who was
something of a fatalist.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't you believe that we won't find it," declared
Jim stoutly, "but no work for me for a while. I'm
going to take a good rest."</p>

<p>"So say we all of us," chanted the boys.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said Jeems Howell oracularly, "If
it pleases you, and Christopher Columbus," with a
wave of his hand toward Jim, "who discovered this
savage group, we will now adjourn to my castle on
the distant hillside."</p>

<p>"We are with you," declared those assembled in
unison, and in a short time they were making
their way up the slope towards the "castle" on the
hillside, where they made themselves at home.</p>

<p>All the new arrivals at the island were soon fast
asleep.</p>

<p>Later after several hours of rest, they occupied
themselves according to their different ideas of comfort.</p>

<p>The Spaniard amused himself thrumming on a
guitar, that belonged to one of the Mexican herders
on the island. Tom got a book, and stretched out
on a rug forgetful of all his recent troubles, while
Jim and Juarez borrowed a couple of guns and went
for an hour's hunting, in the woods which at that
time covered the mountain ridges of the island.</p>

<p>That evening they were all gathered in the cabin
before the blazing fire on the stone hearth, while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
outside raged the Easterly storm that Jeems Howell
had predicted, with rush of wind and sweep of rain.
But the slab cabin was storm proof and comfortable.
It is a good place to leave the boys after their days
of trial and bitter hardship. In our next book we
will meet "The Frontier Boys in Hawaii, or The
mystery of The Hollow Mountain." There, I feel
confident they will cope with adventures as unusual
and as remarkable as they have heretofore encountered.
I am sure that the Reader will be anxious to
accompany them on their journey. But we must
permit the Frontier Boys to have the last word, in
this volume.</p>

<p>"Do you think that Captain Broom, will return
here, before we get away for Hawaii, Jim?" inquired
brother Jo.</p>

<p>"I certainly do," replied Jim, "and we will be
right here, to give him a warm and hearty Welcome,
you can rest assured of that."</p>
